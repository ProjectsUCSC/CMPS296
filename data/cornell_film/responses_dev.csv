i really dont think i need any social advice from you right now
youre welcome
like you care
i wish i had that luxury im the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i cant go because you won  t
what
why
but you hate joey
as in
you did what
after that i swore id never do anything just because everyone else was doing it  and i havent since except for bogeys party and my stunning gastrointestinal display 
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
im not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
god youre just like him just keep me locked away in the dark so i cant experience anything for myself
i guess ill never know will i
so did you
you set me up
what to completely damage me  to send me to therapy forever what
its just you
perm
no youre not dating until your sister starts dating  end of discussion
then neither will you  and ill get to sleep at night
exactly my point
and wherere you going
otherwise known as an orgy
if kats not going youre not going
its just a party daddy
daddy no
why
the prom  kat has a date
its that hot rod joey right that  s who you want me to bend my rules for
youre not going unless your sister goes  end of story
i have a date daddy  and he  s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
didnt have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan  arent they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you
never
just sent em through
so they tell me
north actually  howd you   
yeah  a couple  were outnumbered by the cows though
thirtytwo
how many people go here
yeah but these guys have never seen a horse  they just jack off to clint eastwood
you burn you pine you perish
bianca stratford  sophomore dont even think about it
i could start with your haircut but it doesnt matter  shes not allowed to date until her older sister does  and thats an impossibility
because theyre bred to  their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them their gene pool is rarely diluted
joey dorsey  permashitgrin  i wish i could say hes a moron but hes number twelve in the class  and a model  mostly regional stuff but hes rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
sure do  my moms from canada
you mean id get a chance to talk to her
thats her  biancas sister
unlikely but even so she still cant go out with you  so whats the point
you wanna go out with him
he seems like he thrives on danger
they always let felons sit in on honors biology
forget his reputation  do you think weve got a plan or not
thats what i just said
i thought you hated those people
like we had a choice  besides  when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca
in that case well need to make it a schoolwide blow out
are you kidding  hell piss himself with joy  hes the ultimate kiss ass
its a lung cancer issue
dead at fortyone
okay  i wasnt sure
its her favorite band
hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and 
the hell is that  what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her
no i  m not
best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile
yeah  well see
ive retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think youll find helpful
so what does that give me  im supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who cant play their instruments
dont make me do it man
its off the whole thing
shes partial to joey not me
sure
i don  t know  i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
she just needs time to cool off ill give it a day
she kissed me
you get the girl
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow  tough break
not at all
away
and why would i do that
what do you think
yeah whatever  i want you to go out with her
you just said
but youd go out with her if you had the cake
youre gonna pay me to take out some girl
how much
fine thirty
fifty and youve got your man
im on it
i got her under control she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
what
forget it
a deals a deal
do what
enough with the barbie n ken shit i know
are you lost
we dont chat
were not
does this conversation have a purpose
uh  yeah  were old friend
what  we took bathes together when we were kids
hey  its all for the higher good right
patrick verona   random skid
im sure hes completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
block e
just a little
an attempted slit
but imagine the things hed say during sex
you could always go with me  im sure william has some friends
william would never have gone to a state school
thats never been proven
does it matter
no fear
who cares
i didnt have a choice
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
i got drunk  i puked  i got rejected it was big fun
well i guess were not since we dont have dates 
okay okay we wont go  its not like i have a dress anyway
oh good  something new and different for us
who
oh honey  tell me we havent progressed to fullon hallucinations
sweating like a pig actually  and yourself
my mission in life
oh right  friday
like where  the 7eleven on burnside do you even know my name screwboy
i dont really think you warrant that strong an emotion
and why would i do that
you  covered in my vomit
i was in the laundromat i saw your car thought id say hi
depends on the topic my fenders dont really whip me into a verbal frenzy

thats what you want isnt it
you know who the raincoats are
im getting trashed man isnt that what youre supposed to do at a party
funny youre the only one
im fine im
i just need to lie down for awhile
i know just let me sleep
leave it to you to use big words when youre shitfaced
i told you
sure i do
because then id have to start taking out girls who like me
see that  who needs affection when ive got blind hatred
who
i hate him
hey man    you don  t think i can be cool  you dont think i can be laid back like everyone else
you know what they say
what
but its gigglepuss  i know you like them  i saw you there
busy
maybe
then whyd you ask
do what
my father wouldnt approve of that that
im gettin there
he just wants me to be someone im not
bianca
what are you doing here
you re so 
unwelcome
dont for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
other than my upchuck reflex nothing
look up sunshine
cmon  its not that bad
forget it  im stayin
maybe
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect  and piss you off
so howd you get chapin to look the other way
yeah well dont let it get out
acting the way we do
i dont like to do what people expect then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
something like that
how
for   
fallacy
hearsay
i hate peas
youre sweet  and sexy  and completely hot for me
no one else knows
go to the prom with me
you know what i mean
no what
why not
so i have to have a motive to be with you
you need therapy  has anyone ever told you that
nothing  theres nothing in it for me just the pleasure of your company
its scurvys  his date got convicted whered you get the dress
oh huh
what
it gets worse  you still have your freshman yearbook
you were paid to take me out  by  the one person i truly hate  i knew it was a setup
really  what was it like  a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
i thought you could use it when you start your band
is that right
because i like to torture you
don  t you even dare  
i thought we decided you were going to school here  at u of 0
enough
then tell them i had a seizure
i thought you were punishing me
because youre making decisions for me
so what i want doesnt matter
i want to go to an east coast school i want you to trust me to make my own choices  i want 
yeah  she left with some bikers big ones  full of sperm
no daddy
parts of it
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
whats the matter  upset that i rubbed off on her
when i go
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls  i was merely a spectator
no  i believe heinous bitch is the term used most often
just smack her now
hi
yeah  i guess
oh yeah
right
yeah
what
the situation is my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford
dorsey can plow whoever he wants im just in this for the cash

still unknown but were running prints kid over there caught the case
its okay
yeah

no  im okay
i know  relax  take it easy  dont worry well get those fuckers
police  wed like to ask you a few questions
homicide miss hearn  its detective eddie flemming  open up
we dont have her id yet but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel
do you have any czech girls working for you
did you tell him you did
what are you saying
describe him
he had a videocamera  where is she quickly
no we dont mind  you mind leon
no what is it
watch the news
well just so you know  i gave you guys the credit
nah why should you
good  good  commendable
sure  but i would like to ask you something  you got a problem with me
you were right they were both dead before the fire  the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine  thats usually an indicator of something personal
pretty
maybe you dont care about that either  prettiest suspect ive had in awhile
look im not even sure she has anything to do with this  i saw her outside after the fire  thought it was a lead maybe she saw something  maybe she was visiting somebody here  who knows
eastern europe  like what  romania hungary
there wasnt a fire  therell be nothing for you to do
this isnt homicide school
youre polish
stay here
you got any better ideas
this has nothing to do with your fire
this is ridiculous  im not gonna be in your way  we can talk the case over
ill call it tails
better than one
im on my way with eddie  ludwigs 63rd and madison  the suspects might be there already
im on duty
of course
i wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid
she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her
something back home
raw deal
you wanna talk to her alone
what would your girlfriend think of that
my point exactly
so am i
youre her savior  is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building
hey  im a professional
well you shoulda because nobodys gonna believe you didntincluding me
just a shower
no i dont think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it  i mean to say the least you outta know better  you dont know her well enough shes got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her its fuckin over  you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference youre dead
well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not  dont you understand thats why youre a professional
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer  here heres a number of an immigration lawyer  thats how you help her but you cant get involved in her like that  youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case  and lemme give you another piece of advice  maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret  the whole fuckin world watches television  and when you get out there they know your face  and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job  and i get more done because of it
you know i dont know  i like you you remind me of a puppy i used to have he pissed on the rug all the time but i still kept him
what do you want
whats your accomplishment
then do it asshole
if you kill me and film it youre putting a noose around your neck
smarter than americans  youre fed cry baby talk shows all day long  not only will americans believe me theyll cry for me  sodetective eddie flemming would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette maybe you can propose to her now
we dont know that yet  its much too early  theres a lot to be done
there are two bodies found at this point
you know you cant do that  cmon
we dont know  when i have more ill let you know
i cant talk right now  we have some things to take care of
i really cant give out any information right now at this point

permanently disrupted  arent you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money  hasnt this incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist
and isnt there a movie in the works about you
but doesnt the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful
im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to
shes wonderful
well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
how did they manage to do that without any communication
im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this
were trying to get there i hope we can
right just a sec
okay come on down
sure what is it
whats up
yes
interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
yes
its possible
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
no i never did either
i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
that seems very unlikely
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
but not completely inconceivable
i guess it isnt
yes i dont know what to make of it
yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
are you reasonably awake
well hals reported the aounit about to fail again
no
two units in four days how many spares do we have
well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business
yes
well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
i think ill have to go out and burn them off
hes got a point
what is it hal
i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy
sure dave whats up
yes i know
yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
hal is there anything bothering you  anything that might account for this problem
okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
and dont you worry about it
yes it is hal
yes it is
the antenna has to be replaced
it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please
im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
hal switch to manual hibernation control
hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control
hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time
did they have any explanation for this
well what is it
well its silly but if you want to why dont you
still you really dont believe it do you
well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
im fine daddy when are you coming home
yes i know that sweetheart
no im sorry darling i told you i wont be home for a few days
in three days darling i hope
mommys out to the hair dresser
shes in the bathroom
how many days until you come home
thank you daddy
yes daddy
goodbye daddy
thank you
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
ill bet its a fortune
oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow
how is gregor
well where are all of you off to
well that does sound very odd
no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going
thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
please it really doesnt matter
yes very pleasant
fine
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
are you quite sure
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
i see
yes well i hope the crew got back safely
well im glad about that
certainly
dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this
im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
how can you tell it was deliberately buried
any clue as to what it is
tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice
well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that
theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty
i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius
i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
no of course captain i can understand your concern
i will if i can frank
TRUE
thats true
approximately five years after we go into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back is this true
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets is that true
thank you very much hal
roger
hal im going out now to replace the ao unit
hal maintain normal eva condition
hal check all airlock doors secure
opening pod bay doors
it looks like we have another bad ao unit my fpc shows another impending failure
let me see the tracking alignment display
not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure
i want to pick up my car

you got a girl shit the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
you just dont get it do your reggie  there isnt any deal i own your ass
get this  we aint partners we aint brothers  we aint friends im puttin you down and keepin you down until ganz is locked up or dead  and if ganz gets away youre gonna be sorry we ever met

dont worry i got a move for ya an awesome move a guy named luther ganzll be paying him a visit  we go to him right away
what gang you talkin about jack

speakin of moans my stomach is startin to growl
bullshit  i aint moving  till i get something to eat youve been treating me like shit ever since i came out here  if you dont like it you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass goodbye  and i want some food some place nice some good people nice music
yeah i want mandolins flowers they move off down the corridor
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut
shes got the same complaint as half the goddamn population  she cant get the job shes trained for and it pisses her off anyway what the fuck do you care
mission district  gonna find us an indian
last night two nights ago three
you have a good time
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on youtell me a little about her  she got great tits
its a long shot butbilly used to tend bar here a few years back i heard him talk about it
back you up  now why would i wanna do that
but you can handle it all right huh real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
you need five years training to handle a joint like
i got two problems  number one im not playin games  number two you got nothin to bet with
why  anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably cant get it up anyway
what are you talkin about
i dont know what youre talking about i just wanna see ganz nailed
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes
my kind of place i always liked country boys
some of us citizens are with you all the way officer
while youre at it you can give me the switchblade too
must be billys girl
wait a minute  maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us  how about it i been nearly three years in prison and
you wanna leave man  let me take care of ganz all by myself
im impressed with you too jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night
who gives a goddamn what you think youre just a crook thats got a weekendpass  youre not even a name anymore just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
naw youd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
one things for sure jack thats how youll tell the story
how much
jesus
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale its the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen i was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job  some psycho whos out there capping people with some cops gun
you catch on real fastokay jack lets talk deal how much of my money you gonna let me keep
not likely convict
depends on how things work out i believe in the merit system so far you havent built up any points
in the trunk of a car  a lot better than under a mattress right
get this we aint partners we aint brothers we aint friends if ganz gets away with my money youre gonna be sorry we ever met
youre a real case you know that jack
for three years  lets hope it wasnt a towaway zone
i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack
not really  i figured ganz was put down for a long time  and i knew luther would never job me on his own  hes too chickenshit
musta got some primo bondsman
didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
tryin to save his girl man hes in another world
im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl
i let women get to me  the quest for pussy is the meaning of life  i got my own personal philosophy about em  keep women separate from guns money and business  women are for spending money  they got nothing to do with helping you make it
if they dont tell me what i need to know
im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works
if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb
yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
what you dont understand is i dont give a damn about how this thing looks
class isnt somethin you buy punk look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife
yeah most cops are pretty dumb but since youre the one that landed in jail whats that make you
right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then youre all set
you stay with me
ill be there in a minute you dont move your ass right
be polite say hello  this is candy
what about ganz
you missed  luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street made a phone call
let him get some sleep  hes going to need it
so you took the rest of the night off
forget it i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you
you sure thats the reason
bein good at your job dont explain everything jack 
i can just take her right across the street to luthers hotel  all i need is some money for the room
when you been in prison three years it dont take long lets go
luthers on the move
yeah it missed the last four stops
i had it impounded  come on well use it for haulin you back to the slam
i dont know about you but i could use a drink ill buy you one  itll be my goodbye present
naw you didnt let me down  it was a long shot all the way  we gave em a good run at it
dont worry about it
yeah too bad  they were real nice lookin tooin bed together hardly any clothes one watching tv
if shes right and if you dont screw up
ive got to play it rough with them if they know anything im gonna know it
whatever play i maker just back me up
sure ill give you a shot at it but ganz is mine  you know that big indian plays it for keeps
partnership
yeah  but i wasnt there for a second
hey jack real men dont have to go in for that macho bullshit  but i was fantastic
theres nothin to talk about
and youre tellin me you dont want any of this cash
you are an awesomely weird cop sure wish there were more like you runnin around out here
spare met jack im into legit investments from here on in
no trouble jack but listen suppose i stay a crook  whered you get the idea that you could catch me
yeah i read the report
jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian in other words we cant seen like were in the revenge business i know we all know the truths a little different
anthing botherin you besides losin your gun
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one jack
okay  youre not a team player you gotta do things your own way fine  nail this guy and make us all look good  but you better watch your ass  if you screw up i can promise you youre goin down
jack
try not to get your ass shot to pieces we got enough dead cops on this one
i lost them thats what happened
they ran  as fast as they could caught a train
the indian  i was about 30 yards away
right  i screwed up  i fucked up i messed up  anybody could have done better especially you i bet youre real good at hitting targets through crowds
i didnt have the time
just cause you say it with conviction dont mean shit to me how you gonna take to a pink slip huh
im taking my prisoner back to jail
yeah
the truth hurts doesnt it buddy
are you gonna tell me about police procedure  do me a favor dont give me a bunch of crap
every last bit of it  the big guys room was empty
shit
backup man from the east bay worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago
uhh  wong henry wong  he was in on the same job
hey  dick tracy
heres the file cates checks the file
so do youbeen a long day
aw bullshit you heard wrong
nothing came in for me yet  no calls
im heading out how about you
okay  see you in the morning you know you ought to get some rest

i think i met her  now tell us something we dont know like where they stashed her
when how
i dont answer questions i ask em
this is a 44 magnum the most powerful handgun in the world you gotta ask yourself just one question are you feelin lucky
youre hopeless
whats wrong with that
whatd you do
i guess he got the message
positive selfimage problem all over again  you are who you decide you are unless youre the type that lets assholes decide for you
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit but just because i think its bullshit doesnt mean i dont know something about it
hey you know what i really think
i think youre ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear you pull down four bills a week which is damn good and you mix the best pina coladas ive ever had i think that if you need bigger and better things  then go for em
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead
maybe you dont know what the hell youre talking about
what do you want to know  what difference does it make  im the guy in your bed the last three months  i make you feel good you make me feel good  what the hell else do you want from a guy
thats the way i see it too
you sure you want me to
i think you forgot this hands him his wallet and badge
yeah one of my favorites
jack are you okay
bullshit  ill tell you about bullshit  my guns a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it  it isnt my macho bullshit thats killing people my gun is 
i didnt get burned two cops did listen ill tell you about personnel responsibility  i like to get the job done right  and if i dont get my job done right im for shit
thats right  im not like you im not gonna sit on my ass wondering whats right and whats wrong theres a psycho out there killing people with my gun and im gonna get him  because its my job and if you dont get that
elaine look im in the middle of sone stuff right now im not gonna have time to come by i dont know when i can get there

thomas welles  nice picture

how much
four hundred a week off the books
sounds good pops
tomorrow night i get off at eight
wake up pops  your education begins tonight
interesting theory
child pornography
snuff films
what other ways are there to get illegal films  who do you see
twentyfive
i dont know where are yours
im not mixed up in anything hayseed  what are you talking about
yeah im a real genius  what choices have i got  fuck just because i know about stuff like tonight doesnt mean i deal it  i work a job  it beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers
you cant sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb  so what am i gonna go off and be a race car driver  go to harvard  run for president  what about you pops
i see a ring on your finger  you have any kids
so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this
a weirdo making sm films  whod have thought it
specialty product
where does he sell it
nothing illegal its always borderline  like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images thinks hes making art
im a working stiff pops
you want me to come out there and play private eye
see ya
its their presidential suite
its cheap and people know to mind their own business what have you got for me
who is this in the mask  who is he
i told you hes one of dino velvets stock players
nobody knows his name  thats his thing  he always wears a mask  you never see his face  he calls himself machine thats what they call him  machine
what kind of junior pi would i be if i didnt go with you
devil frightened me as much as it excited me but id be hard pressed to choose a favorite
im trying to figure that out myself  i have to see machine without his mask
nope
its money  people use it to purchase goods and services
its not my money  the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought  lets not make a big deal out of this okay  go be a race car driver  go run for president  whatever
i try to be
apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
thank you
hes a lawyer  please sit here
ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire
my condolences
ill do whatever i can to help
mostly  thats where he started his empire building  he was a good man  notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated  he wanted to be legendary
we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine  we had our troubles  there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him  i loved him deeply
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to  other than that theres never any reason
you hired someone to open it  ill bet the lawyer loved that
do you want to tell me what you found
im afraid i dont
mrs christian please will you sit down a moment  i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film  but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth  like red light district folklore  theres no such thing i can assure you
no
im telling you its not that
will you watch it and see for yourself
i told you i cant not yet
no  for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police  ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously  ive thought about it and theres no other way  if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen  im telling you i wont  if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
youve found missing persons before
i know what im asking  your compensation will be appropriate to the risk  youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it  i feel responsible mr welles  you saw what he did to her
my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
the checks were for odd amounts
okay i follow you so far
youre joking
im here
for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations  who knows  it sure could have  id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
send it to me through the post office like we arranged  no return address  you dug this up all by yourself
youre one hell of a detective mrs christian
mrs christian tom welles here
i dont know if lucks the word are you feeling alright
i hope its nothing serious
ive made progress  im in manhattan  once a few more pieces fall into place ill drive to you and give you an update
how will i get it to you
hello mrs mathews my names thomas jones im a state licensed investigator
i dont understand who are 
yes but
neil neil cole
no
they hired you  youre like a private detective
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat  drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh  and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her
no
she didnt seem herself  for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it  one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone  she took some clothes
i dont know
yes
we were divorced by then  things fell apart he was living with a friend
it got to be too much for him
there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never  my husband his heart broke when mary left
you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either
no one knows what its like  you cant even imagine how much it hurts
of course
okay
were all like that
no
what
there wasnt one  the police looked
i dont know  i think so
no  you dont have any reason to think that
will you let me look
youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go  police are just as human as you or i  they could have missed something  they probably didnt  wouldnt you rather know
yes
its been six years
mrs mathews  its thomas  do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
i have to tell you something  it wont be easy for you to hear  its about your daughter mary anne  when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware  if you read it youll know what im telling you is true
she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress
who is this

thats her suitcase  i had forgotten it till you showed me her picture
she was the kindest sweetest girl youd ever want to meet  oh i adored her  i supposed i always hoped shed be back  after a time all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things  can you get this suitcase to her parents if you think its appropriate
none too discreet is he

youll hear all kinds of stories theyll tell you it was murder but it wasnt

he invited me to his house last night
it was supposed to be  dad had a heart attack two days ago
it was moderate  hell be all right  but it was out of the question his coming along
not in two days  look  do you think i uwantedu to come  if it didnt mean so much to dad  proving his depthexplorer  its the last thing id want
your out  this came for you 
dead  matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital
your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow  we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome
uyouu said it  but i wont argue 
were uallu risking our lives
youre really a mixedup oddball arent you
you mean unothingu is worth fighting for
you may not uwinu them  but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them  or as much as we have of them  theyd have disappeared ulongu ago
thenthis is a flying saucer
 any more than being the son of captain neilsen does
id sooner swim
yes
but if they udou
i wouldnt worry  so long as we have boats like the tiger shark  and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father 
but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work  she deserves a fighting chance
so they caught up with you too
uthatsu the worst possible moment
disappointing a ubigu girl
huh
i guess
so
a lot of people think like that
have you ever talked to carl  tried to see his side
sounds like it  distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing
skipper  look at the depth gauge
us
not ualoneu youre not
whats more important  theres our problem  the bow ram  the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose
go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
listen  hear that
strange you didnt hear it omit 274f
you know  it uisu
lets get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon
the sound again
somewhere down there
well have to look for them later
im with uyouu
oh it does
whats goin on in here lad what  
right skipper
seems to be all around
idont know
speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north
what
right at our oneeyed friend
the frogmen
sidearms  but the saucers dead
yes griff
something wrong
why do you say that
what
wonderful
radiation levelconstantly rising
anything 
what about time
under uwateru
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force  maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
what direction does the system indicate
theres got to be an explanation
as ready as we ucanu be  ill report to the skipper
i did go  just back  reef these are a couple of our passengers  sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent  my exec commander richard holloway
who with
huh
i think i should have joined the air force
after torpedo room  report
take a look
thirtyfour seconds
thats what i said
we can uramu him
its the screws skipper  at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom
what
nothing we can do now
minus three
come where
point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you
 for horrors like yourself
your friend was to remain where he was
i am afraid not  therefore 
on the contrary  i want you  unharmed  perfect
i have selected you to return with me  along with several other specimens for study  we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers
thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
obviously
thank you
the pattern  each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole  a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
ill be another
our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
or perhaps until he gets us
but uanswersu are what we need  not more questions
toward the pole
all right  go to it
been putting my files into it you take sugar and milk

he musta found out they had to get rid of him and jackll get blamed
same old shit

he cant fire me lariviere already did that this morning
it would help if you were married if there was someone at home while you work

no not exactly ill look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn interview your daughter jill right
fine ill need a 500 retainer you can mail it
hard to say if we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on ten or twelve thousand dollars she could win on appeal if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming theyre unduly restrictive it wouldnt be more than twentyfive hundred
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the

from boston evan twombleys sonin law  he was driving i know where theyre headed up the lake agaway the old mans out deer hunting with jack hewitt so they probably got some big weekend party planned
for a while
okay shes fine

yeah
yeah

im going to start one of those custody suits i dont give a fucking shit you know
yeah i mean that
the hell she isnt lillians been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her im gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing this divorce thing rearranged ive been thinking about it a lot its like she owns jill or something nobody owns nobody especially not kids and i pay her
tonight lets get together
theres something funny about that shooting theres lots funny about it actually
im sure im positive it didnt happen the way jack says it did
ive been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley instead of twombley shooting himself ive been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose
jack doesnt need money
jack wouldnt kill for it besides who would pay him
the mafia hire jack hewitt
you wouldnt have done anything like that shot someone for money
but not now
you knew me as a kid
what way
its nice
im her father  supposed to be but im not able to yes yes i am it may be the only thing in my life ive been so clear about wanting even if it takes a big fight
theres another thing ive been thinking about i dont know how you feel about the idea margie because weve never talked about it but ive been thinking lately ive been thinking we should get married sometime you and me
ive been thinking about it thats all
it was to the same woman i was just a kid  its not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought something for you and me to talk about and think about you know
good
dont you think its proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
i just want to pick up my divorce papers for the lawyer it wont take long
the trucks here looks like theyve stayed inside since the snow started
think theyre alright
how
wade
jesus christ pop lets go home i got waylaid sorry

look thats temporary believe me theres so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days my getting fired by lariviere and merritt wont matter a bit
im just cleaning out some of this stuff thats built up for the rummage sale and some things for the cleaners and the laundromat
dont be silly hi jill
theres a furnace
its broke i guess theres an electric in the bedroom
when did she die
can 
hows that
jesus christ mr gordon when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons i dont call ahead for an appointment
im issuing you a ticket moving violation
yesterday morning you passed a stopped school bus which was flashing its lights then you
dont ever put your hands on me mr gordon
dont give me a hard time mr gordon im just 
yes heres your ticket
i was im wade whitehouse i was wondering is your husband here
well yes im i want to say that im real sorry about your father mrs twombley
well yeah i suppose sure i just had a little business to settle with mr gordon im the local police officer
oh no no its a its a traffic thing no big deal
you be careful of that little bastard hes dying to get in your pants you know
what
fuck wade whitehouse its people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering whatever somebody does to improve things around here you gotta find fault with it
this town sucks
that goddamned woman thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this im more than pissed margie im a whole lot more than pissed i been that plenty and i know the difference this is different
not since last night he took a guy hunting
jack
where howd you hear that
no i ive been out on the grader all morning twombleys summer people massachusetts friend of gordons it was his idea for jack to take him hunting  i gotta go
its called a grilled cheese sandwich you dub
his office you mean my old office
he got his deer yet
a lesson in work and its rewards youll thank me for this one day  sally turn off that tv
attago
nothing
sleeping
from wickhams been a while like some coffee
were alright your mas sleeping you want me to get her
shes coming
i checked on her she had the electric heater cold dont bother her as much as me which is why i give her the heater
in the living room
wade i thought she was alright till this morning she was
come on smart guy tell how its no big deal tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that womans head
you think you can take me now come on try
you dont know me you dont know me  so fuck you fuck you
love im made of love
everything you know is from me
bang
crawl
i dont know you my goddamn father and i dont know you
wade
there was something it happened up your way
wade its late i know youre probably at tobys but im in bed reading we got different habits
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business
twombley
you think jack shot him
they were out deer hunting right jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body
huh
how was she
who
what happened
yeah i guess
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days rolfe and some night im going to bite back i swear it
no no i havent not really ive growled a little but i havent bit
what about jill is lillian bringing her
no thanks i dont drink
what about her
yeah shell probably quit her job and stay out here with pop we cant leave him alone here hell set the damn place on fire with jill here a lot itll be good to have margie around things are going to change in that department by the way i got a custody lawyer in concord im gonna see him tomorrow all hells gonna break loose but its worth it
anything new about the shooting twombley
want to know what i think happened
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
that it wasnt an accident
well your friend i think jack hewitt
money
they wouldnt deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
okay its likely there are people in the union who dont want twombley to testify they probably include his soninlaw whos vicepresident and will probably be the next president i read that in the papers whats his name mel gordon
heres my theory twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out finds out his soninlaw is involved
a hunting accident is perfect
not particularly
i care about what happened the truth im a student of history remember
yeah
of course it happened why would i lie about it
you think i wouldnt remember a thing like that
wed have to go digging in vietnam to ask him
well i never heard that one
thats what you think
wade are you alright
for what
take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things call chub merritt get your car back call a dentist for gods sake and get your tooth pulled dont trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police let them work on this
well you arent the president dear
im sure hes busy
alice

thanks  wrote it last night
put together a score sheet  ill make some calls
an exercise in futility send the nimitz back in
does your office have anything to add mr dean
weve got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace
i hate to be pragmatic but theyll sacrifice pawns before kings it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff
like any good poker player theyre checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard
iraqis wont buy it either theyre already in on this or theyll think were spying
to swear you in as president
yes mr president
because it is my duty
my loyalty was never to my country
about goddamn time
air force one acknowledged  tnt emergency parachute launch ramp
roger
ga get it
sir this plane carries the president of the united states
dead
nine
we checked the manifest everyone was accounted for
why did they do that
well it worked
avionics compartment its the only place you better get zedeck down there fast unless of course youd rather be a martyr than a savior
were not going to make it
where are we now
no if we land this plane anywhere else we will end up another entebe  the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud evades missiles and  refuels in midair call the white house
romeo tango zulu copy one the television graphics of the first family against the presidential seal
stand by
tower here
copy air force one
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you  now if youre all cleared  you can follow me then
this is a remarkable aircraft
a dubious distinction no
conference rooms though some have other functions  the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center
thank you
maria maria mitchell
how are your fellow hostages feeling ms mitchell
very good thank you ms mitchell
what do you want with us
come on alice
or you will do what mrs marshall  but i admire your courage your husband on the other hand
i know he left you behind
your husband is a coward he sends soldiers halfway around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night
yes
i neither enjoy nor dislike i do what is necessary
that was war
no
you will be the first to pay for that mistake
please you can kill me but leave my daughter alone
jim
youre very valuable and our nation needs so many things
over my dead body
call up petrov and order stravanavitch s release
pity mr gibbs
youll do it
good good
you dont like seeing people get hurt now in morality that is a virtue in politics however that is weakness  you were a hostage to everyone else                     long before you were a hostage to
one thing ive learned as
let my daughter go or ill take you out
hold on alice
okay gentlemen well take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane lee go huddle with the dod i want an options paper on this in 20 minutes
you heard me  you congress and cabinet heads
yes youve made yourself quite clear
im sure we can strike some sort of arrangement land the plane and well trade you hostages for fuel
theyve gotta be joking
tell our boys to cool their jets i dont need em creating policy for me
gravity
we cant jump from here or at this speed but if we could get a message out  tell the refueling plane
eighteen thousand feet sir and two hundred knots otherwise its suicide
yes sir
that isnt necessary
cant it wait
rose i dont have time for this
shes a big girl  she understands
and when have i had five minutes when i wake up in the morning and im already three hours behind schedule  what do you want me to do rose tell the g7 to fuck off because im a family man
what
but thats the point jim were right here
i should trust that promise because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut

shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in
please dont start with me
both of you
flying the plane
excuse me
no good i said they disabled the communications system
white house situation room
actually sir you could be that someone
theyre still alive but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes
you know my policy we dont negotiate with terrorists if we start now all of america becomes a target
freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed i cant live with that  im not royalty im an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office  we dont negotitate not as long as im president is that understood
were under attack

uh oh thank you  its nothing
not dr barrington the world renowned agronomist
im familiar with your work doctor youll have to excuse me i have to go
im getting over it  if a relationship isnt working you cant force it
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
we were in love but im not sure i know what love is anymore

i just wish it was that simple  we really were in love  you know how it is when you laugh all the time
well we laughed  we laughed all the time
thats very nice of you thank you
thank you cream
were you vacationing in los angeles
no im from washington dc im a lobbyist for the small businessmens assocation
well after a thing like that you wouldnt be expected to
well im afraid thats a question thats all too easy to answer
i wish i could fool myself into believing that thats the reason the truth of the matter is nobody ever asked me
mines eleanor eleanor schiff
no im all alone
thats a very nice compliment and id like to say thatyouve done the same for me
oh yes come in paul rex will be right out
well to tell the truth they really didnt fill me in on many of the details just told me to pick up captain kramer
shep no ill bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there
shep no he gets so excited when new people are here
can you fly this airplane and land it
i uamu serious and dont call me shirley what flying experience have you had
lets see those are the flaps thats the thrust this must turn on the landing lights
chicago the passengers are beginning to panic when do we start down
yes everything theyve got how are the passengers doing
surely there must be something you can do
and the last thing he said to me doc he said sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the zipper i dont know where ill be then doc he said but i wont smell too good thats for sure
i cant tell
wellnot for another two hours

thats right
yes yes of course
a hospital what is it
certainly
well we had a choice steak or fish
he had fish
lets see now the copilot had fish what did the navigator eat
extremely serious it starts with a slight fever
no
well
i think you ought to know what our chances are the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane but who didnt have fish for dinner
ted
i just dont want to go over it any more
i have been patient and ive tried to help but you wouldnt even let me do that
it takes so many things to make love last most of all it takes respect and i cant live with a man i dont respect
i wont be back ive requested the atlanta run

your uwaru urecordu youre the only one keeping that alive for everyone else its ancient history
but if youll just give me

i love you elaine
i remember everything all i have are memories
thats the way ive always wanted it to be elaine
headquarters what is it
seven lieutenant zipp died this morning ted doctor sandler says youll be out in a week isnt that wonderful

thats lieutennt hurwitz severe shell shock he thinks hes ethel merman
ted i dont want to stay here its time for us to go back home  to the plans we made before the war
thats what ive been trying to tell these people
and a little ice
sluggish like a wet sponge

all right hes on final now put out all runway lights except niner
yeah i think he is  hey fred
well it wasnt all that i had hoped
what is it
oh jack im so warm im burning up
im sorry son but you must have me confused with someone else my name is roger murdock im the copilot
i think you should go back to your seat now joey right clarence
i think youre the greatest but my dad says you dont work hard enough on defense
and that lots of times you dont even run down court
and that you dont really try except during the playoffs
im randy
i thought maybe youd like to hear a song
okay this is one of my favorites
i will but jim wont
oh stewardess my husband is very sick can you do something please

oh  i havent flown for a long time
no no thank you
the cockpit what is it
would you go up please
thank you randy you better leave sweetheart you might get hurt in here
does that cost extra or you throw them in
the girl out front mentioned straders assistant somebody named watson  maybe he knows
not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later
i think youre just a little scared now about what you might find once the lights go out  a little scared and a lot curious  maybe more than you want to admit  but doesnt that turn you on that curiosity and fear swirling together  think of it as broadening your horizons
your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes
yeah
thats right
ssai kss  perfect
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is
show me
jesus sykes  its been less than ten hours  me and alterez are on it okay
you ever try to make a case in slagtown  the list of newcomer informants is about as long as the list of mexican war heroes
id like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid fedorchuk see how much surfin youd do
lay off asshole
yes
sergeant detective  i wasnt aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet
you were partners with him on some slag  uh newcomer real estate thing
no sergeant  not history  eternity
this is becoming a serious breach of security
it is his new partner that im worried about
this is getting out of hand  i want you to deal with it  immediately
here
sergeant id like to thank you for what youre doing
i am george
my true name is sstangya tssorentsa
that is exactly so  it is like your name sykes  im sure it doesnt bother you at all that it sounds like ssai kss two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium
his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
through the chest  rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
there was no wallet but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
the murder at the minimart is not our case  the captain said
yes
nothings wrong  i just want to get something straight  you agree that theres a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right
possibly  good  well would you be willing to accept the theory george that possibly by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other  does that sound unreasonable to you
great  well im sure glad thats settled arent you
nothing
shouldnt we examine their personal effects
a rubber  a condom  you know coney island whitefish  men human men put them on their uh  penises  to protect against having babies  you need this for anything
and that fits
and still it fits
how the hell do you know that
so the slag theyre cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery  id say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible  okay next step  i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night
why the hell  great fine  you talk to the wife
did you learn anything
awright  what about the other guy
did you talk to him
wed like to ask you about a business associate of your warren hubley
whyd i do what
my partner is dead  because one of you bastards killed him  then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown where hes home and dry cause nobody sees nothing nobody says nothing
at the end of the bar
uh matthew
but i 
screw me  that cant be right
your mother mates out of season
stay back  im okay
from quarantine when my people first arrived here  he and i were housed together
in the camps we were lodged four to a room  the selection process was entirely random  we did not get to stay with our friends or families
yeah sure  i knew that
three months  we learn quickly  we adapt  it is our strength what we were bred for to adapt to hostile environments
this is mole  its good
our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked
ssloka  it means literally small but intelligent creature  it loses much in the translation
sstrokya sslato na
todd watson  the assistant manager
when will strader return
through his ass  next time you see him tell him to call me unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes
my wife  she worries about me
you are married
we mate for life  divorce is a strange concept to us
i appreciate your honesty george
maybe not i dont know  im not sure im gonna go  she doesnt need her burnout of a father there
in the other mans rectum
ta sstrakyona
no shit holmes  youre only from another goddamn planet for chrissakes
dont count on me george  i never had any ideals
yeah go home  get some sleep  you do sleep dont you
a man a human was wiring it to your car  i didnt get a good look at him  i must call my wife
george shes not gonna divorce you you mate for life remember
to the to the beach
why
come on you wont have to get near the water
thank you
nothing
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub
you must leave me alone on this
no  i cannot involve you  this is not your concern
 it is called ssjabroka  to us it is a potent narcotic
like your cocaine i suppose  the high lasts several hours  we would receive small amounts of it as a reward for our labor
we all did
no i am sure not  that is why i am so concerned someone must now be producing it here  but none of my people know how to make it  the process was carefully guarded
your people dont know about this part of out past  and they cant know  it would threaten our entire existence here
i must trust you matthew  i cannot stop this without you
harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
if the drug is here we must destroy it
where is the drug  where have they taken it
stay out of this matthew  tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall
the fifty kilos matthew  i have to find it  i cant let it get out on the street
fuck procedure
ssai
itd be for your own good  i think youd be better off with a partner whos a little more by the book   still i gotta tell you george for a quiet guy youre sure hell on wheels once you get going  id kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective
there  go back  down that side street
do what  george 
 its harcourt
no hes not  not if he overdosed on the drug  massive amounts trigger a a change  your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but its really a state of incubation  when you emerge youre
we cant let him get away
because because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming
you understand that  but how many others will
you look very good
what is it
only holds five
no two
well one of the men didnt like him so much
we think he coulda been involved yeah  you know him

that is the question of the hour  we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization an ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
well the queen is always physically larger then the others  a termite queens abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cant move at all  it is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors  she is the center of their lives quite literally the  mother of their society
hard to say  it may have been blind instinctattraction to the heat of whateverbut she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldnt destroy her without destroying ourselves  thats if she exists of course

majesty
you do me too much honour sire
ahha

well there it is now to business young man we are going to commission an opera from you what do you say
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
your highness
im thinking about herr mozart what is your view
yes
and the result satisfies
ahha favouritism but i so want mozart
you please me court composer a very clever idea
well there it is
majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
well sire i made some inquiries in a routine way i was curious to know why he had so few pupils it is rather alarming
of course not
really
yes
it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it im afraid
no no please it is not a holy relic  you know we have met already in this very room perhaps you wont remember it you were only six years old  he was giving the most brilliant little concert here as he got off the stool he slipped and fell my sister antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did jumped straight into her arms and said will you marry me yes or no
the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg
really oh grazie signore sono commosso e un onore per mo eccezionale compositore brilliante e famossissimo
did we vote in the end for german or italian
because ive already found the most wonderful libretto
its actually quite amusing majesty its set  the  whole thing is set in a  in a 
in a pashas harem majesty a seraglio
what on one hearing only
yes indeed
oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
of course i do its very good of course now and then  just now and then  it gets a touch elaborate
well i mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say  how shall one say director
my dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening i think im right in saying that arent i court composer
which few did you have in mind majesty
enchanted madame
well  well we havent quite received my fathers consent your majesty not entirely not altogether
twentysix
thank you sire
what is it
ah by all means
yes sire
who told you this majesty
well yes i admit it is
well majesty it is only a comedy
sire i swear to your majesty theres nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics
ah love again
i have no idea
well six or seven minutes maybe eight
you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
i agree majesty but im afraid its not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
in my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir plain german for plain people
well there it is
your majesty herr mozart 
hes here
i will
am i not welcome
is she not here
oh yes oh i mean no  not exactly like this i mean today  just today stanzi  i remember now she had to go  yes she had to help her mother yes shes like that her mothers a very sweet woman youll see

how is your financial situation
thats not what i hear
they say youre in debt
how many pupils do you have
yes
how many
composition doesnt pay you know that

its too dangerous papa but theyre going to love it ah there she is
why didnt you mention it in your letters

this is just a game papa
i want you to come back with me to salzburg my son
but my penalty ive got to have a penalty
mine
i never saw this girl in my life  is this a kind of joke
papa
no one calls you that
hush im talking to his majesty your majesty i wish to express only one thing  that you who are the father of us all could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers it is not for nothing that the fifth commandment tells us honour your father and mother that your days may be long upon the earth
good morning sir
i will sir
yes thank you sir
bene

yes what
in there sir
im leaving im not working there anymore im scared
you dont know what its like herr mozart frightens me he drinks all day then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse
i dont know he has pains
here in his stomach they bend him right over
im frightened sir really when he speaks he doesnt make any sense you know he said he saw  he said he saw his father and his fathers dead
i suppose so he sits there all he time doing some silly opera
please dont ask me to go back again im frightened im very very frightened
are you herr mozart
my name is lorl sir im a maidservant i was asked to come here and offer my services to you
theyll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon  anonymous
yes i can live in or out just as you wish
stanzimanzibanziwanzi

and which one of them do you want me to teach
madame

strudel this is herr mozart say good morning
well yes on the whole i suppose  how long have you been playing fraulein
well im a good teacher the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs please let me know goodbye fraulein goodbye madame goodbye sir
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
really perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
well since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
if a man cannot earn he must borrow
no doubt sir but i am endowed with talent and you with money if i offer mine you should offer yours
please ill give it back i promise please sir
really
ah
ah love well of course in italy we know nothing about that
but this is absurd
did you like it then
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today dont you agree
your excellency you requested some specimens of my work here they are i dont have to tell you how much i need your help i truly appreciate your looking at these i have pressures on me  financial pressures as you know im a married man now
she is well she is  well actually im about to become a father she only told me last night you are the first to know
so you see this post is very important to me right now
why here is the music its here i am submitting it humbly isnt that what you wanted
filled thats impossible they havent even seen my work i need this post please cant you help me please
whom did they choose
sommer herr sommer but the mans a fool hes a total mediocrity
but i cant lose this post i simply cant excellency please lets go to the palace and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice he could actually do musical harm to the princess
you dont mean to tell me you are living in poverty
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
how is that possible you give concerts dont you i hear they are quite successful
of course not
im afraid not
ah how exciting tell me more
come come mozart im interested truly
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone
forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
what exactly are you working on
i dont think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you and he has a daughter will that do
its unbelievable the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music pages of it
i dont know they say ive got to rewrite the opera but its perfect as it is i cant rewrite whats perfect cant you talk to him
oh i could kill him i mean really kill him i actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry
oh no my wife took it out in time
its not fair that a man like that has power over our work
oh excellency would you
thank you oh thank you
i know its outrageous still if the public doesnt like ones work one has to accept the fact gracefully
well i can speak for the emperor you made too many demands on the royal ear the poor man cant concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
i think its marvelous truly
i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend do you know you didnt even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
i wouldnt presume all the same if it wouldnt be imposing i would like you to see my new piece it would be a tremendous honour for me
grazie mio caro wolfgang
how could i not
how could it not excellency
i never knew that music like that was possible
oh no one hears such sounds and what can one say but  salieri
what work
what dead who is dead
who are you
how much
work fast and be sure to tell no one what you do you will see me again soon
are you neglecting my request
im taking you home youre not well
not here shes not well either she went to the spa
youre so good to me truly thank you
i mean to come to my opera you are the only colleague who did
this is only a vaudeville
do you mean that
i have bad fancies i dont sleep well anymore then i drink too much and think stupid things
the doctor thinks i am but 
im too young to be so sick
no no its him
the man hes here
finish what
yes can i  could i help you in any way
my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
of course
then let us try together id regard it as such an honour tell me what is this work
the end of the recordare  statuens in parte dextra
consigned to flames of woe
what
oh yes
come lets begin
we ended in f major
so now  a minor suddenly
what time
yes
i think so
yes
please just one moment
first bassoon and tenor trombone  what
also identical
oh no now for the fire  strings in unison  ostinato on all  like this
i think so
yes yes  go on the voca me suddenly sotto voce write that down sotto voce pianissimo voca me cum benedictis call me among the blessed
sopranos up to f on the second voca
yes
you go fast
yes
oh no im not tired at all
i can keep going i assure you shall we try
im not leaving you
what for
i  i dont think you have herr director not yet i mean its quite n  of course ill show it to you immediately
exactly
well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i dont care
but your majesty 
just let me tell you how it begins
certainly herr director
yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaros wedding
but surely the emperor didnt mean to prohibit dancing when its part of the story
taking out what you should never have put in
oh yes certainly certainly herr director
what is what
because his majesty wishes it
on the contrary
mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
a little modesty would suit you better
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
mozart 
mozart 
look young man the issue is simple if you want this post you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that
oh german german please let it be german
why not its charming i mean i dont actually show concubines exposing their their its not indecent  its highly moral majesty its full of proper german virtues i swear it absolutely
baron
sire only opera can do this in a play if more than one person speaks at the same time its just noise no one can understand a word but with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and its not noise  its a perfect harmony isnt that marvelous
elevated what does that mean elevated the only thing a man should elevate is  oh excuse me im sorry im stupid but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things old dead legends how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
i am father vogler i am a chaplain here i thought you might like to talk to someone
you tried to take your life you do remember that dont you
in the sight of god that is a sin
do you understand that you have sinned gravely
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
that makes no difference all men are equal in gods eyes
offer me your confession i can offer you gods forgiveness
my son there is something dreadful on your soul unburden it to me im here only for you please talk to me
i know a little i studied it in my youth
here in vienna
im surprised you dont know it was a very popular tune in its day i wrote it how about this
i regret it is not too familiar
i didnt that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
ah  youve heard that
and do they believe it
do you believe it
he was murdered father mozart cruelly murdered
did you try
you cannot say that
gods ways are not yours and you are not here to question him offer him the salt of penitence he will give you back the bread of eternal life he is all merciful that is all you need to know
my son no one can speak for god
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries i treasure them as you should
his funeral  imagine it the cathedral all vienna sitting there his coffin mozarts little coffin in the middle and suddenly in that silence music a divine music bursts out over them all a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri what sublimity what depth what passion in the music salieri has been touched by god at last and god forced to listen powerless  powerless to stop it i at the end for once laughing at him do you understand do you
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing how does one do that how does one kill a man its one thing to dream about it its very different when you have to do it with your own hands
i did
i poisoned his life
what difference does that make
no father from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me whenever they say mozart with love theyll have to say salieri with loathing and thats my immortality  at last our names will  be tied together for eternity  his in fame and mine in infamy at least its better than the total oblivion hed planned for me your merciful god
dont pity me pity yourself you serve a wicked god he killed mozart not i took him snatched him away without pity he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory he doesnt care understand that god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses he broke mozart in half when hed finished with him and threw him away like an old worn out flute
yes
italian
exactly
yes
ive seen the manuscript
never mind
incredible
about the ballet
excuse me  didnt his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
yes in the third act
well done sire
did we
for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
well the play makes a hero out of a valet he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher do you see the implications this would be in a grander situation as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor
what who the devil are you
oh well thank you how wonderful some people get all the luck
i cant wait
what do you mean  now
oh im tender enough for you my boy im tender enough for you
i agree baron
no baron no im afraid mozart is a lost cause he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna he is constantly drunk he never pays his debts i cant think of one person to whom i dare recommend him
indeed just a moment  as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him a very appropriate person to do so yes
who is she
excuse me my dear
show her in then go to bed
he didnt say sir i told him i didnt know when you would be back but he insisted on waiting
yes i am looking after him
well hes sleeping now better not
oh yes hes just exhausted he became dizzy thats all we should let him rest
of course
bene
yes  and congratulations to all of you it was superb
yes indeed goodnight to you all now it was perfection  truly
the american yes duck
what do you mean how did he look
im an orderly not a bleeding psychiatrist i push things about but ive little say what happens to them
miss gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
dr hirsch
yes doctor
yes doctor
he said jack
what happened to them
no sir of course sir good day doctor
yes i believe he did
come to my office miss price
yes sir
at my flat im off at midnight and
alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies
has his friend appeared to him again
what did he say
warn him
i tried to investigate the attack there are no records the case was closed and now theyve misplaced the file davids lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did the goodman boy is already in the ground so hes no good to us so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things
they were lying there were no witnesses no escaped lunatic the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there
i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret im convinced that like david they believe in this werewolf
no he knows no one in london besides me i shouldnt have left him alone
david has suffered a severe trauma i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldnt david and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldnt he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
oh i dont mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon but in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others
lets call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
is he all right why didnt you call me where was he
the zoo is he rational
have you read the papers today have you listened to the radio or television
is david acting strangely
yes i should think so
yes doctor
hes fine well come right over
no a cab will be faster
tea would be nice
david
i beg your pardon
what
yes
im not very hungry thank you
please really im not hungry
how is that
leave the pills ill take them later
call me alex
shall i be forced to feed you mr kessler
shall i be forced to feed you david

a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court by samuel l clemens this is after the preface but before chapter one a word of explanation you all right
ahem a word of explanation it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about he attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company  for he did all the talking we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd
im sorry i woke you up
no thank you just keep me company for a while
i keep having these really terrible dreams they are getting worse and i cant seem to stop them
will you come with me
im serious you dont know me and i know nothing about you we have a perfect relationship

forgive me im trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it
now im embarrassed
a werewolf
ill let you know the next full moon
your dead friend jack

i would think so

you did did you
hey you asshole i want you to arrest me
queen elizabeth is a man prince charles is a faggot winston churchill was full of shit
shakespeare was french the queen mother sucks cocks in hell shit fuck piss
youre going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you
this isnt mr goodmans idea he is your good friend whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities
youve left my wife a widow and my children fatherless and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolfs bloodline is severed and the curse lifted
no david harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead the undead
no but were about to
quiet everyone hush shhh
oh come on tell us
thats very funny that is
you could have told them

do you have bad dreams too
yes but does everyone kill bambi
where am i
london wheres jack i had a strange dream
the guy i was with is he all right how did i get to london
get your fucking hands off me what the hell is going on here
youve been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
youve suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while youll have some dueling scars to boast of that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow they say a mad man has the strength of ten
now weve just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now miss price will see to your needs rest now
so they said
in time im sure it will all come back to you
sure as a kid but never so real never so bizarre
ive told you it wasnt a man it was an animal a big wolf or something a rabid dog
look dr hirsch i know ive been traumatized but jack was torn apart i saw him a man cant do that to someone with his bare hands
did you see jack
did you talk to the police in east proctor did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
you really think im crazy dont you
of course not david ill fetch in young miss price
yes
david
oh i dont know i mean look around isnt this a fun place
im sorry northern england first italy later
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
shes a jerk
im talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
i dont know
if you dont stop im going to kill you
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
weve known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolfs head on a spear as their symbol
a severed wolfs head on a pike as their symbol
i assume full responsibility
shall we
nice to see you
listen at least its warm in here
its a fivepointed star
you ask them

apparently so
i dont know lets see if theres an inn or something up the road
come on im freezing
i dont know now that were out here and its three degrees im not so sure i wouldnt rather face a bloodthirsty mob

lt villiers and sgt mcmanus are here to see you doctor
roger mathison doctor

weve got spirits and beer if its something hot you want you can have tea
no
but i can heat some up for you if youd like
i beg your pardon

has mr kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
sgt mcmanus are you suggesting that david and jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police we have two witnesses to the crime youll forgive me mr kessler if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
and what sergeant

well find him not to worry
you here again what do you want
listen i told you i wasnt interested in that deal didnt i

yes sir
yes sir
oh is he we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city were fools to tolerate it
dickson doesnt have to go but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do  why it will take control away from him well put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again thats what good it will do
take it easy clark
all right let him im sick and tired of hearing about him if he wants to run the bank let him do it i dont want any part of it
i think mr dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you dont mind
just pure luck
not at all thats alexander hamiltons idea5  the finest banking mind this country has ever known those are his exact words gentlemen character  its the only thing you can bank on and its the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
i know dickson thats all very well but youre taking too many chances in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble in case of emergency
gentlemen you notice mr dickson refuses to consider our wishes he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust  the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as    as faith
what about
what do you mean help
that sounds very simple dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
aw theyve gone crazy you cant reason with a mob
so thats it eh youve waited a long time for this chance havent you  well im not going to resign now  or ever
i cant you just wait and see if that run doesnt stop within the next hour ill shut the doors you know what that means the bank examiner will step in tomorrow youll be forced to liquidate ill insist upon it the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar whats left you gentlemen can have but ill guarantee there wont be enough to pay your next months garage bill
the bank all right do anything you want with it
weve been waiting fifteen minutes
of course yes just what would you like to know inspector
thats very simple i was home
oh yes of course there was someone with me a lady

you understand
somebody must be in good humor he was humming mother machree
all right jack all right
stand back inspector let me out of here or ill shoot you

yep
hold on hold on we all know bob is an important part of the gang
what will be
if youd read about it first youd have no problems
ive robbed just as many banks as you have i know this town and i know this bank and i say its an easy job

we didnt zerelda did turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw
you pay me to find you bluecoats there they are
you ride like a comanche

get buckets
strategically

yesss but i was thinking i could come by and then take zee out some place near with other folk near here  but out
zerelda its no coincidence the railroad men come through offering to buy up land nobody sells then they start hanging men who own farms for treason
the bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood praying wouldnt hurt
i fooled them into thinking i was alone
i think hes already feeling better
im upset too zee but jesse and cole know what theyre doing im sure they wont press their luck
so we got a plan
pff they hardly even noticed you
mmhmm
you could have worn one of those big floppy womans easter sunday hats

i reckoned
im sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
all this time in the saddle we get to the farm im going to shoot this damn horse just on principle
we better go to docs see whats going on here
youre doing just fine
saved all our lives doc none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms doc gods honest truth
think about this if we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
maybe maybe
you can shut up now
i swear ill shoot you in your sleep
what worries me is that jesus is talking back
your zee hmm  from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world

laws dont touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
when my name makes them cry in their sleep when ive brought them to ashes
jesse what are you thinking there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
shes the most wonderful woman in the world cant get her out of my mind
shes beautiful smart and has the biggest buck teeth in all of missouri
thats why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
ive got you you keep me busy i figure well get over to the hotel get checked in cleaned up then id like to do something ive been thinking about for a long time
hmm what
blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james only a dime in the hotel lobby
oh im not finished  when he sauntered into a saloon his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple  as i said hmm
jesse have you ever noticed that when youre trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy
stop it this is just sad
what
yes maam
you are a hell of a woman
yes maam
ill explain on the way
but i like the presidential suite
so ill get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains
not that day i am guilty of many things but that was mr thaddeus rains and parker that day
pity
last february
you had all those cattle there so id think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive
the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town
i went myself to oversee the operation didnt help much
i figured
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it
im not hanged yet
ahh youll miss me
hes too important james  theyll set the army on you you and your wife
thanks
fair enough
you dont think godll mind do you
i could have lied i suppose but i want this marriage to be legal i just want you to know im trying to start a new life here im depending on your
thank you
right here in church
im the same age you were when you went off to war
no
yeah hey are you drinking whisky youre too young to be drinking whisky
i guess so
tonight why im just getting ready to turn on the younger charm
you been with a girl ever
i think so
i swear
you do that
its his money  hes putting up the payroll out of his own fortune you do want to hurt thaddeus rains dont you jesse
this time well make an exception
youre gonna tell her when youre resting up in bed with her jimmy
i hope you dont mind jesse james told me your name
yes but just so i could find out who you were
i hope im not being too forward
i just though you were awful cute
lyla devereux
could we go upstairs and talk its so loud down here
that is so gentlemanly of you
really
im doing you folks a favor 
its not my job to relax ive put men facing out both ways down main street so nobody can ride in shooting ive got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case
they had to be dealt with
they donate money to farmers to churches rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of maddox so much money they were able to build a school
move you fools
and it is my pleasure to be here
no it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen
two weeks ago we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers
unfortunately not sir a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable mr alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident
yes sir
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers
i see ill get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
how much did they get from the safe
ill kill them for blowing up my railway
then who did
what is going on here man
we should go burn that school to the ground sir
i look forward to seeing it
sir
what sir
oh that ill let jenkins explain
i remember you
not such a menace now is he pinkerton
not to mention my men who lost their lives
oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too
would a jury around here convict their own i think not were beginning an interesting game here mr rains
im afraid our adversaries dont agree
it is a nice piece of writing
oh thats the best part
im losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
so you cant tell me anything
all of the james gangs encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this groups cunning
i cant believe this
i demand action
cant you tell me anything
no
in english pinkerton
can you put men at all four
what is that
vengeance

oh really i didnt know that
absolutely im 100 with you
don

dan great to see you again like i said you need anything at all im your man i dont envy your job i mean owen was acomplex man
yeah gone into rehab shame  is he a suspect
godi guessi was probably returning videotapes
wait thats not what ive got
thats not the information ive received
lets see  that you were with
wellwhen was the last time you were with paul owen
patrick please i hope ive been informative long daya bit scattered
great yes id like that
absolutely im with you on that one
not a big music fan eh
well to each his own solunch thursday ill call your secretary about reservations
not in the mood i guess
yes of course the hash browns are delicious im justnot ordering them

but how where do you place paul that night
and
marcus
but marcus denied it
well does marcus have an alibi
i checked it out its clean
where was marcus
so who was he with
personally i think the guy went a little nutso split town for a while maybe he did go to london sightseeing drinking whatever anyway im pretty sure hell turn up sooner or later  i mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous isnt that right patrick
its cold out too isnt it
why dont you get a job if youre so hungry why dont you get a job
why were you drinking is that why you lost it insider trading just joking no reallywere you drinking on the job
im so hungry
im not
im hungry
im hungry
what am i gonna do
al
al
you re so kind mister youre kind youre a kind man i can tell
pleasei don know what to do im so cold
i canti cant find a shelter
ive been great and you
itsitsall right
oh well you know
oh yes im very lucky
yeah well youre late
we shouldve gone to dorsia i couldve gotten us a table
i could tell you that halberstam but then id have to kill you
cecelia is wellyou know 
another martini paul
twohundredandfifty very reasonable lets leave a big tip shall we my place hr a nightcap
come on you dumb son of a bitch  ive got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us
theyre okay bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste but then sports came out in 1983 i think they really came into their own commercially and artistically
yes owen
no owen
yes it is
youll look like you consciously worked for the look
what shit now where do we have reservations at i mean im not really hungry but i would like to have reservations somewhere
some guys are just born cool i guess
they still have to give em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs
gonna wait outside
make him
you know what hes like he just wants to work on stuff thats cool
i can paint anywhere
anything thats not even credible if he wants to go up there to check it out i think you should encourage him  its his life but everybodys treating him like this  valuable object youre hurting your own case
cmon how often do you talk to somebody whos been on the cover of time three of four times
then youve gotta ask him about that
if hes really a bully he wont cop to it anyway
but hes not quite the same guy anymore dont get your hopes too high
i think thats great milo i do
didnt you visit the campus
no way you have this  destiny
dont bring that up like a different girlfriend woulddve let you die
probly waiting by the phone for outpost to call well leave it for him
were not gonna let it
milo what about 
thats what i need to ask you  you know you cant keep anything from me
what would it mean anyway if he didnt write it
i know i know
isnt that  extreme
youre right its  a working relationship dont know what i was expecting
teddy was killed last night
it was a hate crime
i dont know what im saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
i dont know i just know it was teddys code all these ideas flying in from everywhere you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business its like they know what every kids doing
nobody does work like this online its in your pc or in a mainframe selfcontained theyd have to be like watching people physically  oh jesus
youre scaring me i think we should just go
like this its gary youre talking about
milo why would he 
even if all this were true therere 20 other buildings all of them filled with computers and 
milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place how could they hope to hide a surveillance post  and how can you get in there anyway with the cameras and the swipe cards 
you cant just walk in either
is it two or is it three have you ever really noticed
whaddo i do
nothing
why
i remember
guilt
poor baby you know thats not true
different
okay yeah i did something naughty theres this amazing comix store in seattle  to tell you the truth i did it once or twice at stanford guess i cant keep anything from you
what
he has thousands of employees milo 
milo 
milo you 
i went to see the skywire model in garys office you know just to hold it again
just shut up
look at me im gonna change
yeah give me a goodbye kiss
i know you youre gonna run back to work right after dinner i want my kiss now
dont we have any chopsticks
great
its gonna get cold
youre just afraid to eat it
no
hell tell me when he gets home
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something
prick
he wasnt acting
right whats that mean again
its just  i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something
its  milo isnt it
give me two seconds with lacy here  go on in i wont be a moment
yeah hi thank you for seeing me
i am i am sir
my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
it was racially motivated hes chinese he was and i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that dont they
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice theyre neonazis
just didnt know who else to talk to
yes sir
thought if i relocated it could help my case im writing programs for the local public access station where any whackjob with 100 bucks gets his own show god does it suck  can you help me
forgot to introduce you  i have a girlfriend
you cant preempt yoga thats our biggest show
no but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this were gonna bring down outpost
whatd they ever do for you
great great we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door 
wanna be a part of history
gimme the coordinates
is it your dish
hes working backwards too  lets do number five
you shouldve called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
thatd change with a criminal indictment
isnt there a stigma bankrolling this guy
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away theyre calling him the digital robin hood
we tried
oh hi
hes pretty tight with his family
he just likes to write code hes bummed theres so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
i think they call him the houseman cause guard sounds too weird
milo gary boyd im hoping you and your friend can come up here weve made some amazing strides in digital convergence id love to show them to you
would you like a coke or something
theres a rumor going around maybe youve heard it
low enough to relay internet traffic
skywire
it needs a more objectoriented language this doesnt scale does it
i do
okay im gary
do i
thats insane youre ahead of your time
dont spend too much time searching you ever vetted somebodys old code before  its a different skill stay close to the surface the besthidden secrets are in plain sight you know the best place to hide a leaf right  in a tree
maybe im going too fast
take a look at this slightly different approach
youre making me young again
well  you sent for me
whatre you implying
im sure
definitely
were the flags for teddy
just once guess i was worried we didnt have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
talk about work never
oh yeah
it helps alice said it would help to focus on something  dont know what id do without her
34000 but theyre real short lines just came out that way
the wrong place
you look a little tired
have a look
my dad was a compulsive gambler only he didnt think he was that applied to guys who didnt have a system losers who played games of chance he could read people so chance had nothing to do with it no matter how deep a hole he dug himself hed give you the whole speech and youd better not point out the obvious  his creditors would catch up to him loan sharks or whatever hed wake us in the middle of the night off wed go again
worse
dont be so hard on yourself with a brain like yours you could connive with the best of em i bet
sorry about the late notice
i couldnt do it at work cause of security or at home for  obvious reasons
im not much good at handwriting or parties
you see whats hanging on the wall
i do know gary i feel the same way i thought i was coming here for a job but its meant a lot more
i do know you focus on the big problem but somewhere down the chain something breaks down something gets destroyed at first its upsetting you feel youve lost control
startup not 50 miles from here kids on prozac
there may be a little less trust after your outburst
nothing does still i want him to like me
gary dont worry we 
longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes 
lets go
wait he knows
knows im altering the coordinates lets jump to 12
just do it
in exchange for endowments they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after em
you do
you are naive look at your employment contract you cant work anywhere else in this field for at least few years  not that i dont miss you
he was on the verge of something too he was gonna show us the next day he said the answers not in the box its in the band know what it means
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
well come up with the next big thing
got out of my other commitment
cool
unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil tell em there may have been a breakin
keep looking
any irregularity in the pattern
lets get him in here
they know just they dont trust me with it so well get the evidence first ask questions later
im calling gary
where we going
i launched skywire just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to garys satellite
you know my name
youre famous around here
i wouldnt worry about it youve gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
something like that yeah
no i know what you mean i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers least they make sense sometimes you think theyve betrayed you like a person would but then you see no you just missed a step you can go back and make it all work
graphical interfaces for skywire im sposed to coordinate with you
yeah i ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to 
no please
there is no second place plus every time i get jammedup gary has an inspiration  is it like that with your counselor
right right but does he ever just like hand you code
youre compulsive
whys that
then and now  but not right now
she saved my life
why would you do a thing like 
the day care
but why would they 
oh yeah
theyd frame him
theyre already watching you if they had to theyd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout hed wake up not even remembering his act of revenge
hmm
no no never
theyve got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person its over
theres always a logical answer  you just have to define the question
therere so many disinformation sites about gary already where he has devils horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein
right but garys tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
certainly not at my happy home
what about 60 minutes
but still you cant say cbs wouldnt love to break something like 
timewarner has a 40 per cent stake in garys settop device that also takes out cnn  ge joins outpost in new venture which means nbc is out disney joins outpost abc is out outpost and newscorp in new deal fox is out any of these places could have a mole or all of em  its like a a continuous loop we can go to some alternative press place that 1000 people read get them and us killed but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something garys got a finger in
what
a what
but theyd still get the idea right
its a standard gui once ive got a concept its maybe three days work
before they kill somebody else too
you mean  break in
and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 arent hot yet you said the place isnt finished
i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally
oh  i liked you i was checking you out
cause their apartments might be bugged
whatd he say
gary
the dishes are juiced up too
milo shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
he doesnt know about the day care
yeah thats old in a tree
milo what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four am and tells them about it
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
thats lame isnt it
he suspects i know something i think he was sort of  explaining himself to me in case i do  we have to go in tonight im two hours from a beta version  but ive gotta go home for an hour
she called to apologize i said i was pulling an allnighter she said then come home just to say hi which i always do when we fight its suspicious if i dont
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary
tell me youre not calling on your car phone
its three years old it 
but you said the other 
lets try 2
what
wait a second he knows i know
and your phone messages you wanna do what you do its not a crime
uh not exactly
hey we got seed money for the startup a millionfive
outpost made me sign 1000 guess well find out what else we have to talk about life stuff
what
jesus teddy
i met this girl
i dont know
no i keep thinking itll go away but theres this  connection shes been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot plus i see her every day were working on the same program shes  beautiful
what dyou mean
what does that mean
i didnt plan this
oh were not going to the campus
his snapples were in alphabetical order
shes a programmer

well done mr powers were not so different you and i its true youre british and im belgian you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding youre thin im about forty pounds overweight ok we are different im not making a very good point however isnt it ironic mr powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be evil maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of face it freedom failed
really theres nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster

i beg your pardon
excuse me
im sorry
mr powers please i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand i would appreciate it if youd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest
a chigro

i hope this is part of the unfreezing process
i understand that mr powers but let me be perfectly clear with you perhaps to the point of being insulting i will never have sex with you ever  if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation i still would not have sex with you
yes weve had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone an onboard computer and a global geosynchronous positioning device oh and finally this

dr evil
its about the sharks since you were frozen theyve been placed on the endangered species list we tried to get some but it will take months to clear up the red tape
well we experimented with lasers but you would be surprised at how heavy they are they actually outweighed the piranha themselves and the fish well they sank to the bottom and died
sea bass
theyre mutated sea bass
please allow me to demonstrate
evil actually doctor evil
dont be so hard on yourself youre here thats whats important a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
weve heard from scott now lets hear from you
thats not true doctor please tell us about your childhood
hello scott im your father dr evil  i have a son i have a son everyone i have a son  someday scott this will all be yours

i had the group liquidated you little shit they were insolent
scott dont say that
gentlemen i have a plan its called blackmail the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
people have to tell me these things ive been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here  ok no problem heres my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser  using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
right  oh hell lets just do what we always do lets hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage  gentlemen its come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days heres the plan we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom  for one million dollars
all right then  five million dollars
oh really  onehundred billion dollars  ok make it happen anything else
great
hes asleep
oh god no i made him sleep on the couch
why
you cant judge him by modern standards hes very much a product of his times in my day he could have any woman he wanted
you have to understand in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth it didnt matter
just wait once austin gets you in his charms its impossible to get out
of course not i was married to your father
austin is very charming very debonair hes handsome witty has a knowledge of fine wines sophisticated a worldrenowned photographer women want him men want to be him hes a lover of love every bit an international man of mystery
i know let me just say this austin was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had
im on with a friend  look id better go i love you
well its kind of weird
ok well i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago he was partially frozen for thirty years i never knew him growing up he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
i dont wanna take over the family business
i dont know i was thinking maybe id be a vet or something cause i like animals and stuff
no hes really evil
ok scott no one really wants to kill anyone here they say it but they dont mean it
shame i was recommended by a friend

eh in here
if nature gives a man a collectors mind it doesnt matter what he collects butterflies old china penny farthings a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass
we have met 
this isnt a game
rules are made to be broken
then who wins
hmmm 
let me guess  father
something strange is happening and whoever knows about it doesnt want us to find out
ropes
he tried to warn us 
directed by laser bounced by satellite quite possible
after the cold war 
you need treatment mrs peel  you cant resign
we want to help
the death of peter peel was a great loss to us all 
the institute  the funding 
quite frankly  it could have been you
to find out who killed my husband
so am i
next assignment
thank you steed
thanks valentine 
darling emma  yes we  the true genius behind the prospero project 
dr darling peter  all you 
you killed my husband
too many cooks 
but i found you all the clues led me here 
but  why
our revels now are ended
im already married 
valentine listen to me 
ring
youre mad
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale youve seen a few samples
one very small thing a diamond cyclone chip a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size if i possess that my powers would be unlimited my dear halfbrother was developing it but he suspected sabotage he gave the chip to  you mrs peel i want you but also your ring
how wagnerian  do you mean to say youve waited all these years because you couldnt create a chip on your own that would have amused peter
what are my choices
ill never marry you
and you must be steed please dont get up
i had a spot of bother at the door
1922 why the kippers
so what was all this  some sort of test
whereas you are
rules are made to be broken
and just what is the game
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
and now that weve settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you
mother
were not here to talk about the weather surely
a kipper or a red herring what were they investigating
really  i fail to see the connection
yes indeed i need protection
oh absolutely but trubshaws a man worth meeting no point setting out half shod
ahh perfect fit the luxury of a handmade shoe as unique as a face or a fingerprint or should i say dna
thank you trubshaw 
do you really think so
not all tradition is bad mrs peel no thank you
a gentleman has to have a code this is part of mine a uniform think of it as my suit of shining armor
the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
as per mothers instructions
for a man in my position 
they call me in when theyve reached a dead end freelance like yourself
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea
i meant me
an eccentric recluse
june july  august
any other vices
small talk  try the weather
you should be dead  how do you feel
you were very lucky  four shots to the heart i found you after i slipped away from sir august mother brought you here not me you should thank
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
why should they think that
frankly thats how i remember it
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
did he say who
did you say formal i must dress
you mean my other self 
i should have thought that was obvious   im in mourning
how on earth can you tell
very good steed 
any ideas
is that written in his shoe
she had this in her mouth there there
thanks   i see what you mean about letting me do the risking  hello
dont bother  heres a bus 
is there anything that isnt
filling in mother natures blind spots  
but if someone miniaturized the process
sounds as if someones hijacked your research
 and by you mrs peel 
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters  no undiscovered twin
according to dr darling youre a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior  qed
oh well   just my type mrs peel
have i trespassed on a male prerogative  were being followed i saw him at trubshaws 
barely
heres the one that broke the camels back
i expect well have to gatecrash
mrs peel  
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists im so sorry i struck you mrs peel please forgive me i thought you were someone else 
i expect thats for you to know and me to find out 
orders
nothing personal
no trouble
always  except 
 when i dont it comes down to one thing mrs peel trust
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
keeping a stiff upper lip
not for a moment
arent we all mrs peel
i thought you didnt
winning isnt everything
after you  mrs peel 
you dont trust me
you lied
no idea who no idea why 
 or grownups who still like to be children
not to speak of peter and i were both loners there was nobody
im a wanted woman i know 
whys he called invisible
ill catch you up dont worry hes expecting you
hurry  what for  im just now 
have we been invited
its called black leather
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaws
you first
snuff  i must insist you try some
the merry widow i might have known wheres the reception
have a look at this
where are you going
you neednt bother i cant drag you further into this after all i am still the chief suspect
but 
if youd been through what i have you wouldnt 
what kept you
 in a beautiful pea green boat
still a bit chilly 
have you any place in mind
its the latest thing mrs peel
not quite
pity your mother came too 
must be trubshaws busy ill send mother 
im no spy  where do i fit in
youre saying i have no choice
mobile hq in a blue funk  cant take chances im looking after things while hes hiding out 
its mother you have to convince hes very agitated  wait here
decontamination  
i see
peters brother  but 
i know all this
surveillance by whom
whos now vanished
are you suggesting that dr darling and valentine were somehow in this together but thats absurd
getting to what
i fail to see 
well i cant possibly go like this
 and now
let me guess  wonderland weather
i shall need a small plane
im going to find out who killed my husband will you take these documents to steed
global warming
so you say 
we want mrs peel
how did you guess
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance  youre the mole who betrayed the ministry
well you found me have a sniff of this why dont you careful the scent can be overpowering 
brenda and i thought wed drop in
you didnt come to talk about the weather surely
perhaps id better start calling you doctor again mrs peel 
she may not know theory goes she may be very ill
possibly split personality 
who knows if dr darling is right you should watch out
she may try to kill you
how come you took so much interest in her dr darling
anyone particular in mind
too late anyway todays escapade was only for starters this is no ordinary weather its manmade a kind of weather bomb
no her husband she says alice tried to warn us a trap tell mother beware tell father thats all
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation on the day he died he was setting a test to prove to himself  to us that his wife was beyond suspicion he had to be certain he said he was going to give mrs peel something 
guilty until proven innocent
youre getting yourself into terrible trouble my son weathers turning very nasty  and so am i
where
im warning you for the last time steed whoevers behind all this looks like mrs peel walks like mrs peel and kills like mrs peel
i think so thank you so much

this way

so i see youre still in the neighborhood
yeah what have you been up to
really no kidding
i dont want to be your friend brian
when i was twenty
carrying swayzaks notebook
yeah swayzak humanitys last hope how can you work for that guy
 all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
yeah well i like to think im just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters
cmon jennifer hes just another northside jagoff with a mouth
so now you suddenly care about my future
hey sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss but im not gonna be a poster boy for him im trying to do something here theres five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day tell swayzak to talk to one of them
okay ill arrange things with your assignment captain  martys a good man brian
straightest answer your departments given me all week
hows it going
green committed to a thousand  theres another fundraising party tonight martyd really like you to come
yeah well maybe i can fit it in
hey  so are you dating your boss or what
sorry  are you dating anyone
well you did invite me here
boy rimgales as slow as a snail isnt he
yeah but it doesnt take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
but rimgales probably going to come around to arson
got anything to drink in there
homey
do you miss it  you seem like you do
then why did you quit
uh huh
you told swayzak about our arson lead its all over the fucking news
 bullshit you knew what i told you wasnt ready for the papers 
 you could have scared the son of a bitch off we may never bust him now all for a couples political points
yeah and just how much of all this has been doing your job
leave stephen out of this 
 i work for the city
hi
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered i want to know why he keeps that hidden
you could check itd be in his files
yes
your boss is lying jennifer
just take it
thats a dumb thing to say
i quit two days ago brian
i dont have the slightest idea
its a small town
hey do i know you
so you came to me  well this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
whos doing this
then who 
i dont have a story
what
i i thought it was great i loved it it was nothing to these guys medium deal
 i wanted to be him right then i wanted to be him more than anything
the outlets
trychticholorate
after it took your dad the fire did it look at you brian did it talk to you
not such a far walk after all is it brian
you walked out on this academy six years ago one week to graduation you think we forgot that you think i did
look everybody remembers your old man being his son all you had to do was breathe to graduate here dead hero father rule but you blew us off why should i take you back
 i dont give a damn what your test scores were maybe you could have been a good firemen but you had your shot
sorry but its out of my hands try again next year
even if you graduate this academy youve still got nine months of probation thats hard duty son if you dont really love this job itll kill you
your dennis kid  i work alone
get used to me inspector im not going anywhere
i think we should get something straight here i was assigned to this office by the city
pest control
what are you listening to
glass
 another backdraft
no it couldnt
i just rewrote your contract cmere
trychtichlorate is a binary structured 
during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium
trychticholorate then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder
and the putty around the door
but the right guess on this is arson
some people say you dont do much of anything when it comes to this case
what
but he killed these guys
what reason
thats why the sealant on the doors so what have we got a torch with a conscience
are you going public with this
im finished with swayzak ill do whatever you want me to do i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim you gotta give me another shot
fire
son of a bitch they knew each other
and cosgrove coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate they werent very high on seagrave either
who all ended up wearing candles for faces  swayzaks up to his ass in this somehow guy can barely hold a drink in his hand hes so scared
yeah airtight
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report they did exactly one job  swayzaks manpower study its not even really a company no employees no directors just a po box
it had to be someone who knows numbers some kind of fancy accountant but whats the connection
how ya feeling
yeah
no
i hate hospitals youre so so goddamn useless
ive been lying here hours just thinking were close  were not looking in the right place brian this one knows us and were not looking in the right place
yeah
like it never happened
hi helen man you look great
four months
i know i know shoulda called ive been really busy i joined the fire department
yeah youd be surprised what three years can do to a kid
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident
stephens not staying here now brian he moved out last april
you guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile
and im a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian
no need to be modest brian
 that really was incredibly work you did you and your brother fighting fires together helluva image isnt it you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command
brian let me come to the point id like to offer you a job
this ones still with the fire department one of our best investigators don rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now we think he could use another pair of hands and youre exactly the kind of guy i want representing us an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone brian this could be a great opportunity to move beyond a fire engine
nice boat
yeah in fact i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterdays arson announcement was a fabrication by your office they loved it and you know what you were right my family background in firefighting gave it weight
what the hell are we waiting for
engine 115 right
lucky guess  and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments
lots of fires they promote faster there take a look at the last lts list half the guys on it came from that battalion gotta think about your future timmy 115s the station
backdraft
could you believe that fire man first day there i was adcox and me pullin that lady right out of the fires fuckin throat i love it here  no surround and drown for this company fighting 17th goddamn stephens amazing you see how he took that fire by the balls im gonna be that good some day you watch
ah man is he usin that line now on you what you think he made that little gem up jesus christ i used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning
probationary fireman brian mccaffrey on his very first fire showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to doublecheck a burning floor alone emerging victoriously with anna rodriguez a seamstress for the north shore clothing company mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 pulitzer prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his fathers death
theres no replacement cause of your boss cuts if thats what you mean if someone else goes out on an injury were really screwed
its in my blood willy

yeah thats easy for you to do you never had any talent
good morning to you mr delapot

youd take no offense if we called you dela for short
manray needs a job
how much
different
youll both get an advance and you can stay with me
and this is manray
we might need some mo money behind this
my world famous famous world arroz con pollo will be ready very soon

and im the feet
im tired of waiting
are you crazy  the joint is crawling with cops now  you wanna go to rikers  go to the hoosegow
we was coming to see you
were starving
dela i dont know bout this
well do something about it
eureka
some tap dancing some singing
trust me  of course i still have to pitch it to my boss but well have an answer one way or the other
thats right  money turns the wheel
to what
mantan  i dont even care as long as im dancing  which reminds me i need some new kicks
why
mantan
how you sound
manray im very sorry about ya boy cheeba and sloan  believe me it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her just lookin out for a brother  i feel you all this stuff happenin at once but you cant let if affect your work  you gotta be professional
no costume  no blackface
because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country gary i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show its when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist thats when i get mad  no one in any way shape or form should be censored
yes  and i say yes because who is to judge  who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not  who  who can play god
dont you people get it  were in the 21st century  slavery was over four hundred years ago  all that stuff people talked in the old days its over  folks always crying white man this white man that  lets all grow up
can i finish  thank you  i had a great aunt we called her sister she went to her grave not believing man had walked on the moon 
im sorry im late
i didnt find out about this very important staff meeting until
so are you telling me everyone knew about this gettogether except you
cp time is colored peoples time the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late  that negroes have no sense of time  time except when it comes to music or dance
i understand  but again in all honesty i was not informed
i would prefer you not use that word in my presence
i dont agree  the negro middle class does exist and its rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom
to white  i still feel all of my scripts would make good shows
ive never been given a fair shot
im an oreo a sell out  because i dont aspire to do homeboys from out of space secret diary of desmond pfeiffer a pjs or some as you might put it some nigger show  im a tom  im whiter than white and youre blacker than black is that what you think
im not sure if i can deliver what you want
yes  yes  yes  i want a show that will make headlines that will have millions and millions of households tuned in glued to their televisions every week  i want advertisers dying to buy on this show  im gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you
its right and tight  good morning let me introduce you to everybody you know my assistant sloan
im wid it
go on  good so far
so lets take this great form this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
it is called mantan  the new millennium minstrel show
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air  in fact i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial
i dont know if whoopi is the way to go
mantan and sleep n eat  two real coons  i know were way out there but its satire
what are there character traits
exactly
and sleep n eat is his comical sidekick
this could be bigger than amos and andy
letem try  i will kill to make this happen
so what  we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that  no such thing as bad publicity  so what  earlier you said singing and dancing
who are the other characters
in the projects  like eddie murphys the pjs
i dont know about that plantation angle
we think so
to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right  its unamerican  i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job
i want a hot young white director maybe the kid that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
probably nuthin but thats why its such a sexy way to go sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective  a black director yknow what hes gonna do given the subject matter  with this kid the possibilities are endless
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
no  just meet the guy  thats all im asking  look ill even let you choose your own musical director  you can have that
derrick coleman he possessed all the talent in the world coulda shoulda been a great ballplayer but alas dc didnt want it bad enough  delacroix do you want it bad enough to kill for it  do you want it that much
dunwitty dont leave
calm down please
we just punched it up a bit  made it funnier
i seriously doubt that will ever happen  didnt i tell you i know your people better than you do but if by some miracle youre correct im gonna invite them inside my house and well have a sit down discuss it like civil human beings
they didnt even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
hello mommy let me get rid of this other call
i want to meet her one day please tell her the great news  im out like vanilla ice
i want to speak with you
its me peerless
its been a long time
pleased to meet you
daddy shes younger than me
i thought you had promised mommy you stopped
how did you end up here
because i had too much pride  too much integrity  i wouldnt lick nobodys butt  some material i refused to do
another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
the same old same old  trying to get my stuff through
nuthin i cant handle
where do you go from here
i didnt mean that in life
baby you treat me so good peerless youre a good son i love you  you never gave me no trouble
always keep em laughing
is that so
not that often  he was excited to see you
the drinking is for the pain  it doesnt kill it just dulls it
i was a hostess at this club your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life he asked me to come with him  i quit my job and weve been together ever since
your father is proud of you
he did the best way he knew how junebug is stubborn just like you
why didnt you tell me about this staff meeting
what good are you if you dont tell me stuff like this
manray
it hit me like a ton of bricks
the idea was out there in the universe  now what
do you know how you will use him
dunwitty wants a coon show  and thats what im going to give him its going to be so racist so negative he wont have the balls to put it on the air  hence ill prove my point
the point being that him the networks dont want black people on television unless they are buffoons
you getting cold feet
good  im going to need your support
and lose out on my money  the only way i get paid is if i get fired and thats what i intend to do
manray better not be bleeding to death  i need him  after were done he can do whatever he wants to do until then hes ours
this is cheeba
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
it was the principle  dunwitty had to be enlightened  i was making a point  i take pride in my work plus i already told you i wasnt gonna walk away from my money
whats the chances of mantan being picked up
like i said all this for some twisted distorted sense of principal  dunwitty he just tolerates your negroidal ass he doesnt respect it
hello
which one is your brother
im gonna slit my wrists  cut my throat  for the love of joseph
break a leg
lets leave the man in peace so he can get ready
what do you want me to say
the pleasure is mine
cmon  you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family  you gave your brother a shot  thats all anybody can ask for an opportunity a chance a shot  he got his
im sorry i cant help it  its too funny
everybody shut up
a small victory isnt that small when youve been use to losing
a gift
no matter what you think you did come up with something unique open it
this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
i thought it was appropiate
its all good  you got a hit show youre gonna need a bank  plus i love these old black collectibles
to me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior subhuman
i dont want to hear it
youre the one that put us together were friends
hes just playing big brother
please dont go there
i cant lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
light
you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody  i know where i made my big mistake  i have a general rule never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you
thats why it will be so much fun
the first and only time  a big mistake  im gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
dela kiss my big black ass
i didnt think this was in your studies at nyu
give me the gun
he im mona
i perfectly understand where youre coming from  as a minority i can relate to your struggle also  but i think you should give us all a chance  we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you please dont be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas  everybody just talk out loud
pressure  dela you dont know what the hell real pressure is sheeett  this is lightstuff now when you scramblin out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
now im privileged  why  because i didnt grow up on food stamps and welfare  because i didnt call home a cardboard box  no i never ever went to bed hungry and im proud of it too  whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
naw  ill take the zero
i feel fine
sloan will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready
you sound like the media
same thing giuliani said
hope the same thing doesnt happen to me  thats some big shoes to fill
no
yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
yeah
what you did is dead wrong
sloan is the hardest working person ive ever met
i dont believe it
my name is manray goddamnit
it looks delicious
cmon mommy dont start with that im an ungrateful son stuff
cant beat it with a hammer  well since you asked it looks like i may have a new show a pilot being shot
if at first its not what you want just work that much harder peerless
son peerless is your name  now you might be one of these hollywood types change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate
i guess hes still on the road what kind of show is this  are they some negroes in it without being buffoons
peerless i didnt raise a buffoon we have enough of those on television already
i will  and good luck with your show  i hope its a huge success youve worked very hard  you deserve it
ill be right over
he said that
where is he
i cant go all the way down south
i dont even know why youre still concerned over him  daddys not with you
its gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
cmon mommy  daddy hasnt been impressed with anything ive ever done  from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present
you going to attack me too  the show is a hit  arent you happy for me

i never was more in earnest
what is your uncles name
oh yes of course ambassador ogrady
this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland  corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
it was my joke  i was tired and did not care to go farther  theres not prettier woman here than that if she wont suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
i have acted as i think fit
its a lie  youre a deserter youre an impostor sir your lies and folly have confirmed this to me you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you dont know  will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up
how do you do sir
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well  and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas
there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast and wears the red riband and star of the popes order of the spur  he is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
only a very little as soldiers do
i am not sure  the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
not yet but i believe he intends to
and his baggage
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me  do you mind that
faith i think you are a lad thats likely to keep your word
and so i am
mark this come what will of it i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan  ill follow him if its into the church and meet him there ill have his blood or he shall have mine  will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting
hell give the better mark  i am not afraid of him
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
your cousins go out with him
it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck  he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly  but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
i am harry james son and will act as becomes my name and quality
oh its with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
but swords are today impossible captain best is  is lame  he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
it must have been some other gate
a man of honor dies but never apologizes  ill see the captain hanged before i apologize
i had news of you in dublin  faith youve begun early like your fathers son but i think you could not do better than as you have done but why did you not write home to your poor mother  she has sent halfadozen letters to you in dublin
we must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to brown bess
is miss dugan well
good heavens  whatever  has she died of grief
mrs john best  was there another mr john best
the coward
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyships money and pearls
which ohiggins do you know  for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family
ah  i see  no im afraid mine are the ohiggins of watertown
sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
repeat the words again and i run you through the body
i deny your graces accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which i have honorably won
your grace if i am so tame as to take this then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation
i will let down the steps for your honor
you are going to drive to the frontier
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
your honor must lower his voice
as you please
the gentleman has nothing contraband
yes sir  here is my letter
yes sir
herr seebach was a very kind employer
no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
only the agency of servants
id give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
have no fear  it will come out well for me
i have faced that problem before
make your mind easy you shall not be left behind i warrant you  do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in berlin  the dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
then ordering fresh horses the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital  i need not tell you that i was the chevalier
sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you
to risk ones life against such people is an imposition
certain
certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love
very well  now that i know it i will no longer love her
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
that is a trifle strong
have you had one
but for a time a passing fancy
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
have you not a man whom you value
what  you have not met a man worthy of your attention
then you have never loved  your heart is empty
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
by loving you with no hope of possessing you
it is my only object
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me  if i do not know it i am innocent
with a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight
then i will respectfully take leave of her
yes  but i am afraid of being deceived
i ask only a payment on account today  after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
always my dear one never any further  love is a child to be pacified with trifles  a full diet can only kill it
our abstinence makes our love immortal  if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more  but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
my husband has convinced me of the contrary
o my dearest love  enough  i beg you  stop believing in your experience  you have never known love  my very soul is leaving me catch it on your lips and give me yours
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy
we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out  oh my god  is it true  i am not dreaming
roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you  was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ever so angry but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me to your side  did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you  have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it no i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you  i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty  what sacrifice do you want from me  i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me
old fool
agreed
then you must get it
with pleasure at finding the ribbon
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
i dont care a fig for captain best he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man  he looks well in his regimentals too and if he chose to ask me to dance how could i refuse him
oh  i can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner  besides roderick captain bests a man and you are only a boy and you havent a guinea in the world
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier and is famous as a man of fashion in london  it is mighty well of you to fight farmers boys but to fight an englishman is a very different matter
id draw my sword and cut my way through them
well then ill tell you what id do  id jump daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
indeed miss dorothy i intend to have his blood as sure as my names roderick
as much as possible
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
it is entirely up to you  i want the best
all right five hundred guineas
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl of crabs
well sir this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majestys closet and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy  i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the viscounty which you propose to get
yes
yes minister i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein
in so far as i can tell these things  no  i believe the chevalier won the money fairly
the prince left him only that choice
when is he to go
what is to be done
oh i am grateful to you sir  i am the wife of captain oreilly hastening to join him at dublin  my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servantman fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck
everything  my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap
ohiggins mohawk ohiggins
thats very kind of you mr ohiggins
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain oreilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
mr newcombe i have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18 a year interest seems very stiff indeed
i am prepared to accept the terms mr newcombe
provided that they can be assured of her ladyships freewill  are you serious
yes of course
i see
now just have a little patience my boy  your birthday isnt until next week
well well just have to wait and see wont we
good night my little darling
yes
what the devil  what kind of fools do we have here  pottle who told the lad this story
yes papa
is he all right papa
brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away
hang it mr roderick james you have no more manners than a barber and i think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck and i like you sir  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own
would you have me spend my life all alone
the milkmaids daughter
good evening mr james have you done with my lady
come come sir  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
faith sir if i want to learn good principles its surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you
is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as i am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor  isnt it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husbands departure
not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps  why man i have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation  who knows how long i may keep you waiting
i am sorry for you mr james  im grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting  had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic  what are the odds gentlemen that i dont live to see mr james hang yet
blackeyed sczortarska
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
and he doesnt care about me
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
will he wish to know the details of this night
tender hegenheim
you know that was like a quadruple negative
its ten thirty in the morning

cmon ray everyone hates the army during basic ill tell you straight i hated it here
fifteen years ago under sergeant west piece of work that guy i remember he used to have these two silver 45s with ivory handles and if you werent quick enough hed knock you on the head with one of them he still carry those guns
theyre dead arent they

i didnt shoot west 
you saw wests body
yeah 
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession ill write a confession

tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
epilepsy
no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran
pills shots you name it basics a lot easier when you dont feel pain 
the creek bed 
one went off yeah but it didnt touch him  i thought you knew this 
mueller was alone in the cabin
would you have believed me
dont know on a map west told us it was there we just found it maybe the hurricane took it away
cant do that now though can you
we can prove that youre not ray dunbar impersonating a fellow cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself 
how do you know that
sir dunbar sir
sir yes sir
sir yes sir
your weapons sergeant
oh bullshit hes a fucking convict you know how much he hated west 
why
west hes dead
so did we why didnt you come
i
wests any kindling for afire
i mean i killed him  isnt that what we all wanted
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place its gettin bad out there   wheres west
we just want to check your pack 
do i
yeah
you hated west more than any of us
youre the only one missing a grenade
if not you then who
oh come on 
thats exactly what he says about you
enough to go to prison childs px scam mueller was in on it 
look in my pack
just look little pocket
youre lying 
becoming a morphine addict during basic aint exactly something you want to broadcast only mueller and childs know
you saw west right how was he killed
from up close or far away
thats close range you go full auto on a guy from close range youre gonna be swimming in blood look at my uniform nothing
they
what dont you know
no no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the mps 
put it down
coast guard special detective detail we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk
levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to washington and lock you in a very small dark room i suggest you talk to us
but not the only victim right
senator daddy must be thrilled
i think you just blew dont ask dont tell out of the fucking water
you said you wanted to know what happened  im telling you the truth
i didnt kill him 
but you didnt
right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back
i honestly dont know maybe to have someone to cover for him and i wish i could but theres no doubt in my mind he killed those men
mr hardy
stop
how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
my heart weeps
theres that word again  as i told you i wasnt in the room when everyone started shooting
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds the guns went off i ran in childs shot me pike and mueller were dead and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun 
no i said dunbar
well
then well leave it up to the courts  his word against mine what does his father do again steelworker  doesnt matter im sure justice will be served in any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son hes quite protective
i was just thinking of whats going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
i didnt do anything 
because of what i saw  who really killed west
because i was standing next to him
i didnt 
i dont know 
maybe 
maybe he
been better  i read about whats been happening with you i should have called 
would i have called you if it wasnt if there was any other way 
and here you are going out of house hows that make you feel jules
its not west is it tell me its not west
well hes a good soldier
and the problem is you only got three
im assuming thats what made him the dead one
the guy in interrogation said hed only talk to a cop
im not gonna let that happen
he can wait kendalls out of surgery
who killed pike
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
okay then lets widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
from dunbar i hate to break this to you but i dont think hes gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
nevertheless what kendall will testify and thatll be enough
jag gets here in three hours try for the confession
home im done
what the hell are you talking about 
was dead right you think dunbars on the level
does osborne agree
thats horseshit and you know it
i wouldnt know where to start  i guess it was about one man framing another he thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings
the senator
dont be im not cut out to deal with the wests of the world
i thought you said that wasnt a compliment
what are you talking about
youre drunk 
or what youve gone round the bend 
thats preposterous 
i wanted to see if he was okay 
im not even going to dignify that 
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character the army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct theres only one criminal standing in this room and its you
youre crazy 
for the last time i have no idea what youre talking about 
fantastic you want to tell me whats going on
you knew sergeant west
sergeant wests served for twenty three years hes the public face of the modern army
you and the colonel go back
youre the tom hardy ive been reading about in the papers right new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside im not comfortable having you involved in this
hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall 
senator jonathan kendall of ohio
kendall junior is still in surgery so he wont be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour  the cadet were talking to first is dunbar
yes
why
excuse me
that is the most unprofessional 
good copbad cop
ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes
see ray this is what we call good cop bad cop she shouts i stand up for you youre grateful a bond of trust is established
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars 
oh im sorry i didnt know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good  everyone knows good cop bad cop  by admitting it i appeared trustworthy
youre right we should sit in silence
best time for banal chitchat
microrecorder for kendall  didnt have time to wire his room now tell me why you joined the army or ill jab this pen through your neck
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
i lost a bet
yeah thats just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed truth is i dont know the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that didnt really work out
the very same
i plan to grow on you
so noted
imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar
what point
being back here gives me the willies
got it
have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight
i lied wait for it
i dont think that has anything to do with 
everyones capable of murder osborne
well im sure if hed known this was all going to happen hed have tried harder to witness it for you 
i dont know
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what he deserved it theres your confession
watch me
you did more than try you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator youre phenomenal 
oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit this isnt my great second chance osborne everyone thinks im a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that nobody will ever know what happens here 
because its my job because people are dead because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that  we can do this hardy
what
what happened next
and theyre smart about it they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness
exactly someone whos not involved whos word cant be questioned you only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes theyve totally bought into your version of events
and if theyre asked thats what theyll tell the world
kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin 
and all hell breaks loose a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz bang zoom happy ending
that bugs you too
lets go talk to bill
they got their stories straight
what kendall said  the type of guys you dont feel comfortable going to sleep around thats what dunbar said about childs to the letter
positive hardy they planned this
good idea
see i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendalls gay son went nuts on a training mission 
you couldnt have known 
you wanted to get the truth
you mean the falsely accused
yeah
now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
nah
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority and all i did here was follow orders it didnt add up plus i got kicked out
thats gonna stay my secret
maybe maybe we were nowhere near sometimes mysteries stay mysteries  i havent by any chance grown on you have i
good just making sure
get in
right back where we started
isnt this how your story goes
hardy for chrissakes 
no death certificates no crime
seven
seven guys what was it you said you were just starting to believe i wasnt the guy people said
this is the perfect time you know what makes a good detective the number of confessions they get youre a good detective osborne so now you get mine
tough
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
really
nobody saw but i dont think so
yeah i can wait till youre off the base and do it myself
leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
think itll work
want company
i should probably write that down
in case you need me to testify about the shooting theyll clear you
yeah but he was a lot of other things too thanks
what are you talking about
mueller hes as bad as west and we both know it now i cant do it cause im tied up but we get the others to go along 
someone else can do the deed it doesnt have to be you maybe nunez too hes got a tendency to follow mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead  the guys who took out their sergeants killers well move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west all we gotta do is tell the story right
although that wont matter much when coupled with the murder charge 
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
oh yeah excuse me sergeant sir we dont feel like going out  we dont want to get rained on hell kick our asses from here to cleveland
poor fucker my ass
yeah and he doesnt know when 
oh you remember now 
so you took off your shirt
what the truth please there are degrees of truth officer always degrees things are not what they seem
he wanted more than that
youre gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
he whispered it in my ear
because hed shot mueller
like i said i was in the kitchen when i came out mueller and pike were dead nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone
weve been making progress i see
fifty minutes
no but it got you interested didnt it got you to dig inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didnt belong
then hes mistaken you know i really dont think my father would approve of this line of questioning 
you cant threaten me 
what
it will and you know why because youre not a person anymore youre a cadet in the united states army you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights so im gonna throw you to the wolves and unlike you im gonna get away with it because youre pissing me off
wait 
wrong answer 
childs
i scared dunbar into silence hes been trying to cover for me the whole time we got here you came to see me i didnt know if i could trust him with that kind of secret 
he came after us and i told dunbar he had to kill him
toughens us up pike you dont like it quit
what the fuck happened to you one minute youre next to me and the next youre gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas 
blame the nigger then huh someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd 
what the fuck are you doing

its not a woman its a fish no one ever catches her
eighteen
youre pretty good at arithmetic
i suspect it will hurt a lot
i promise someday when im really supposed to
how did you know
apparently ive overlooked this one piece of it and id like to remedy that you see in order for the town to be preserved the trust must own it in its entirety
ill offer you more than its worth and you know you wont have to move nothing will change except the name on the deed you have my word
then i dont think so mr bloom if nothing is going to change id just as soon it not change in the way it hasnt been changing all this time
im not convinced you should be happy
i was 18 he was 28 turns out that was a big difference
i see i thank you for your time
i can get it i can just
please go just go
go
i know
lucky girl
youre lucky to get four words out of them in english but if you were to walk through the jungle youd hear them speaking the most elaborate french those parrots talk about everything politics movies fashion  everything but religion
i was dreaming
thats terrible
no i understand
stop
can i take your picture
please
i never knew
oh so this is a tall tale
well we were all set to but there was a complication
truth is ive been thirsty my whole life never really known why
you were talking about your wedding
i like your stories
really
i can
whats your name giant
mines edward and truthfully i do want you to leave karl but i want to leave with you  you think this town is too small for you well its too small for a man of my ambition i cant see staying here a day longer
i love every square inch of it but i can feel the edges closing in on me a mans life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this  so what do you say join me
okay
beats me
that poet norther winslow did he was going to paris france he must have liked it because no one ever heard from him again  tell you what you take the other way and ill cut through here meet you on the far side
just to be sure you can take my pack
make him stop
i am a footnote in that story i am the context for your great adventure which never happened incidentally you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born
friend of yours did you help him out of a bind
no dad they dont i do not like the story not anymore not after a thousand times i know all the punchlines dad i can tell them as well as you can  for one night one night in your entire life the universe does not revolve around edward bloom it revolves around me and my wife how can you not understand that
your mom says i cant tell you that one anymore you get nightmares
am i
did you do any of that
you think im up for it
really
the old lady by the swamp
no she was old and probably senile maybe schizophrenic
so how does it happen
okay
what did he say
really
theres a lot you dont know about me
you mean while im here
i will
i used to do it when you were gone remember i used to do it a lot
i said this isnt how i go the last part is much more unusual trust me on that
its rude to talk about religion you never know who youre going to offend
oh so you know
yes
i think someone hasnt
dad
can we talk
do i i saw an iceberg once they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water only they didnt count on an elephant being frozen inside the woolly kind a mammoth
what
then you shouldnt have started with a question because people want to answer questions you should have started with the thing about icebergs is
what youre seeing down to my nose my chin
ive told you a thousand facts thats all i do will i tell stories
you think im fake
it would kill you huh
yourself good bad everything just show me who you are for once
the river
how what happens
like this
somehow youre better different youre getting ready to go and i say
you say
story of my life
yes exactly
dont need to apologize to me i mean im the luckiest person youre going to find today
but youre wrong i do know you at least by reputation edward bloom from ashton see im actually engaged to a boy from ashton don price he was a few years older than you
theyre your favorite flower
i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me
i have the rest of my life to find out
go out with me
i see we need to get you one of those plant misters we can spray you like a fern
there is no softer ground than town
really
norther do you ever regret not making it to paris
youre a poet you oughta be able to and maybe if youd seen more you could
i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas
i want you to know when you left spectre it opened my eyes there was a whole life out there that i was not living so i travelled i saw france and africa half of south america every day a new adventure thats my motto
im robbing this place
fraid so
hello
i am and youre will ive seen your picture thats how i recognize you i almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward  like this
this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time everyone in town knew him
wow wow you just said it i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour
because hes dying
my father talked about a lot of things he never did and im sure he did a lot of things he never talked about im just trying to reconcile the two
no its logical if you think like your father see to him theres only two women your mother and everyone else
well therapy and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back i was living in a fairy tale
yes
well have to pick up a copy
ill help you
i need to lie down for a bit
i know it was the same when i was carrying will like clockwork
i do
its more than they thought theyre going to stop chemo
probably tonight
you dont have to
did you
they met at auburn
thats because most of it never happened
mmm what
everyone loves my father hes a very likeable guy
but its not true
youre not
i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him
your father had a stroke hes upstairs with your mom and dr bennett
we swam the atlantic its not that big really
we rented a car
hes up with your father
hes impossible he wont eat and because he wont eat he gets weaker and because hes weaker he doesnt want to eat
you dont talk about those things not yet
really thats wonderful
of course
yes
yes will i do and dont presume things you dont know
yes but thats a different
yes you both think william bloom is a very smart man  the problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someones wife and ive been his wife longer than ive been your mother you cant discount that
but i understand you mom i always have
mom do you know who that is blonde hair
no but its weird she seemed to recognize me
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
he just fell asleep josephines with him
yes
i suppose your grandmothers house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it
heavens no we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place
ill stay why dont you go home with josephine and ill stay tonight

happy bath day
syevodnya

you dont understand anything
its makes it easier okay
it makes it faster if i dont speak to the men they fall faster its pretty obvious why
im going to drink my coffee then were going to the police station where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
well as it turns out i did
no i dont
i know you just want to punish me 
so youre just going to be vindictive
you cant hurt me more than im hurt already

no youre not how nice one how dumb do you think i am 
have you got your passport
shut up have you got your passport
i dont have any money
i said i dont have any
i dont want to talk about him
its none of your business
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
but you know so what
he will come back
he left me my passport and ticket its pretty clear he wants to see me again
no but you tend to tie them up
why not
you dont want to talk about it
okay we wont talk about it
so whats it like having to fuck men you hate
okay lets okay okay you have had sex with people you dont like havent you for money to make money
and its wrong
and that would be morals that would be ones own moral sense of decency
so what then you just detach sex from everything

sometimes
sometimes neither
theres nothing wrong in liking sex john

the other plate is currently in new york in the hands of kobos man find it for me
ill pay you
swiss bank deposit  gold bullion whatever you want  you know the city and the police
youre smarter than kobo  you know the price of deceit  think about it
hell find out you took me  im unprotected  hell kill us  all of us  you dont stand a chance
you want him dead too
we were worried to death  its awfully kind of you
you certainly have a nice place here
if he wont cooperate
i dont think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
where
not to be trapped
then go get him
oh
heres your check my boy  thank you
its not an easy thing to meet your maker
can the maker repair what he makes
had in mind something a little more radical
death
come here
why
what about ems recombination
wouldnt obstruct replication but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and youre got a virus again but all this is academic  you are made as good as we could make you
put it this way  rolls royces are made to last  as least they were but im afraid youre a ferrari a high strung racing car  built to win not to last
i am
also extraordinary things
well no not really  theres mr deetchum hes the watchman he lives on the first floor

dr tyrell
tyrell could help us sebastian
his company made us

tomorrow he says
hello glad to meet you
not if everybody is doing their job here at home  how are things at home
very good pris  now show him why
okay but dont kill him  save a little for everybody  a masterpiece
five  three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation  killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro field
there wasnt much left of him so we cant be sure  but bio chemical data and morphology records of the nexus6 were reported missing  going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voightkampff tests on the new employees  guess he found himself one
were using esper  a 231  that picked up holdens alarm  its guess is that all five are in the city
what was the cover on the one that got holden
garbage man
bryant here  regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants espers concluded that the only irregular category that tyrells got is the entertainment section  you better get on it
if you hurry youll get back before it gets cold  i got a spinner on your roof in five minutes  good luck
then let her get away  i thought you were a pro  youre supposed to be a fuckin tracker
you didnt like her
yeah
this is bryant  are you alone
shes not with you

your customer eh
soon as i finish the job
day after tomorrow
this is esper and im ready  go ahead please
why yes of course
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes constructed of skinflesh culture selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of selfperpetuating thought paraphysical abilities and developed for emigration program  are you with me
unlike a five they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another  sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run
im coming to that  vulnerable zone is the base of the skull the occipital bone  a direct hit is a positive retirement
i know all that

money is no object  hes got cards up the wazoo
whats that supposed to mean
well thats blunt
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing dont you
yeah like ralph lauren
im busy tomorrow anyway i have to buy six thousand paper napkins

hes from alaska
always good advice
eve
adam  i think for you we should go for sweet
its not so much what you say but how you say it  women like men who are unpredictable
right here  well youre being so bossy i wasnt sure
uhhe might of
we did not leave together
im his pimp he left with the dancers didnt he
those sluts
to bed
yeah  im not the one whos in love with the guy
yes you do
uh yes you do
yes you do
you know i asked him about that and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them see youd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners i didnt know that i thought it was a way of appearing superior  know what else he told me
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady
exactly i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible thats it if you dont do that nothing else matters the cars the clothes the houses
from the oddest place his parents told him i dont think i got that memo
he didnt leave with them
he left with sophie
its true  she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear
youre goddamn right i am
coward
i knowi know you did the right thing
what

looks like youd make a good runner
i mean you dont exactly have the build for a football i mean no offense
i mean some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered
well most guys dont i mean thats the point you all mind if i take my vitamins
later mike i gotta take care of someone whos hurt here in case you havent noticed
hey jeff
uhuh
uhuh
its good to see you dad
hey jeff im feelin so much better
i just know thats all i remember you from central
you were pretty popular didnt you run for some office
am i bothering you
yes
terrible boring
yeah what are you doing now
thats too bad
didnt my father tell you not to talk about it 
i dont really know much but bits and pieces i hear things my room is right above my fathers office the ear theres no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person thats direct from the coroners office the person is unknown there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear i heard some of the same names
there were at least three maybe four but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear theres also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned and a musician and some others
no this has been going on for some time several months about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river they were from people who were reported missing they never found one complete body only parts
maybe so
yeah its close by thats whats creepy theyve had her under surveillance for a couple of months except i dont know what theyve found out because my father isnt in charge of her
not really why  you want to see the building come on ill show you
where are they
i dont know like i said shes not my fathers case
my father is watching the businessman the businessman had a partner who disappeared left his whole business and family his wife and two kids they think hes been murdered
yeah i guess so  what are you going to do now that youre home
still it must be kinda rough
i dont know he moved away
thanks for the tour it was nice talking to you
i guess so like you said its a strange world
i dont know
just a minute pull over and wait a minute
im here arent i
ooooo you are smart just dont get too smart
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience sometimes in some cases its necessary to take a risk i got to thinking ill bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that womans apartment you know sneak in and hide and observe
settle down i have a plan which i think will work there is very little for you to do but i do need your help arent you curious about my plan
alright the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later
right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man i will spray her apartment after a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window
you will be a jehovahs witness i have a few awake magazines for you you dont have to keep her very long a few seconds is all ill need whatiya think
lets just try the first part if that goes well well see about the rest no one will suspect us because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this
alright
oh brother dorothy vallens seventh floor look on the mailbox for her number bright boy
alright good luck yourself
yeah lets get outta here what happened
yes and no did you recognize him
i didnt get a good look at him either but he sure looked at me i didnt have time to get a window but i found this key  pretty nifty huh
yeah
pretty clever are you game for more
you didnt goof it up but you still owe me one i want to sneak in tonight its friday do you have a date tonight
well its friday night and youre a beautiful girl i guess you would have a date that does that
i dont want you to get involved really i mean i do but if something went wrong i mean like you said they may be involved in murder
first of all well have a nice dinner try to find out where dorothy sings
great ill pick you up around eight oclock is that good
okay you better get out before someone sees us
first of all were going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens well watch her for awhile id like to hear her sing anyway and then also well know she is there and not in her apartment
then well drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there
two
ill drink to that
why not
itll be okay i dont think you should wait out here though i think you should go home can you drive this car
leave it in the front of your house for me okay
could you wait a little while this key may not fit
im going in sandy ill see you tomorrow and tell you how it went
oh okay can i call
look it can wait till sunday
yeah
are you sure
i dont know if youre a detective or a pervert
okay okay bye
well ive found out some things nothing really for certain there are some strange people involved
well  maybe we should discuss this somewhere else you know what i mean
he got a little jealous
its okay dont worry about it
no way im about to blow up
ok its a strange world sandy this is what i have found out what i think i have found out dorothy vallens is married to a man named don they have a son i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of dons ears i think he is holding them to make her do things for him i think she wants to die the ears were for her a warning to stay alive there is another man involved i call him the yellow man you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door i dont know what he does but i think hes on drugs supplied by frank frank is a very dangerous man
i dont see how i can and i cant prove any of this i got all this information illegally also it could get you in trouble
actually ive been in twice
yes
yeah i mean a little you know
that doesnt bother you does it
thats what i thought
why are there people like frank why is there so much trouble in this world
yeah i guess so  youre a neat girl
i guess so you want to help me watch frank im going to stake out franks place tomorrow with a camera
i will ill pick you up on the same corner at three thirtyfive okay
okay sandy
you better not jeffrey
goodnight
im really sorry
you want to go talk to him
thats what makes it so good you wanta hear what i saw today
number one i saw the yellow man go into franks building laughing with frank now the only trouble is what does this prove
maybe but i think the yellow man is on drugs i think frank supplies him
number two i saw the yellow man come out this time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance number three now get this in the distance was a murder a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead mans place
yeah
im seeing something that was always hidden im involved in a mystery im learning and its all secret
yeah youre a mystery i like you very much
yes is that so surprising yeah i worry a lot i got you into this

and we will send you to whatever god you wish
okay then lets get ya started
rule of thumb

new hitman wants to leave his mark
yeah some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead or silver
the sicilians
they shot him at a downward angle  they put him on his knees
what about one guy with two guns
its gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other
no way they could have seen it
what
why was i not informed of this
crime of passion he just went nuts he would have shot everyone in here he just ran out of bullets
well we didnt get any help on that a lot of people saw it nobodys talking
brilliant so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory top fucking notch  whats your name
twist of lemon
sweetnlow

we have to go now  were on the lamb
youll make it outta here you cant ever stop not ever
yyes my son
why have i come to a church i never have before i guess i just felt i should
its ethics i put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these cocksuckers to slip through ive found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist as if they have gods permission but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them technically
you believe
you feel
you feel a soul is what gives you feelings happiness guilt right or wrong it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today you feel these men are necessary the lord has spoken to you twice this day
you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings is it so much to believe that god has brought you here
it is easy to be sarcastic about religion it is harder to take small hints from god your feelings and listen to them to take a stand
those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision
then you must find out what your beliefs are
you know them personally
do you think they would harm an innocent man for any reason
yes yes i was thinking that too no i was feeling it all i needed was to hear you say it amen ill help them
thank you father thank you  whatever goodbye amen
yes
im sorry im sorry i didnt see
open it
thats who im doing this for now open the fuckin thing
god have mercy on my soul
what do you want me to say
how long since your last confession my son
just go
yeah thanks rocco see ya

what do you mean
save it for bourne
bourne comes here why
never heard of it
with all due respect pam i think you mightve wandered a little past your paygrade
i want to know about treadstone
he does ive been down to the archives i have the files ward
what are you after pam you want to fry me you want my desk is that it
what happened jason bourne happened  youve got the files then lets cut the crap it went wrong conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap bourne was his number one  guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back conklin couldnt fix it couldnt find bourne couldnt adjust it all went sideways finally there were no options left
ive given thirty years and two marriages to this agency ive shoveled shit on four continents im due to retire next year and believe me i need my pension but if you think im gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this you can go to hell marshall too  it had to be done
dead in a ditch drunk in a bar in mogadishu who knows
this is conklins computer
do you know what his budget was
we were throwing money at him throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark
conklin mightve been a nut but he wasnt a mole you have me his calendar for a couple of days ill prove he killed lincoln  this is supposed to be definitive
so whats your theory  conklins reaching out from the grave to protect his good name  the man is dead
ive already got a team there i doubt bournes in naples to settle down and raise a family
and you do from the moment he left treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him
hold on  he said he wants to come in
dont you want answers
its hard to swallow  the confusion  the amnesia  but he keeps on killing its more calculated than sick  what about nicky shes the last one to see bourne in paris shes the one he asks for they disappear
i wasnt sleeping  you ok
they found danny zorns body dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time
did he say anything to you
dont know
im sorry ward
id rather stand if its all the same to you
why would be enough for me
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it
and danny zorn what was that
no good options left
no you lost your way
thanks
the sooner the better
what do you have danny
and
it was staged
jesus
keep going
lots of people
nobody you  i had to tell you right
okay 
i speak english
okay
its nothing its just a picture
no i do
what
yes
then what
you killed them
how how can how can you be here and say this
youre a liar
youre a liar
i cant let you do that either
no  because you dont want to know how it feels
is this really happening
felt a little light
sorry old habits
i like it here  last time i saw you was greece you had a good spot
she wouldnt let me  shes the only reason youre alive
conklin
shot dead in paris dead the night you walked out
i dont know
a voice a voice from the states someone new
i dont know who that is
i dont know why would i lie
i did
im sorry
 my coat  but we should 
 take the back  get another car 
conklin up front
no theres nothing new
two years were scribbling in a notebook 
 its always bad and its never anything but bits and pieces anyway  you ever think that maybe its just making it worse you dont wonder that
i do remember something good all the time i remember you
i worry when you get like this
i dont mean that i worry when you try to ignore it
i should be better by now
but it ends up the same
the telegraph office
we pushed it we got lazy
he was at the campground yesterday
its wrong guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent
no not this this is real  and hes right there 
back there  at the corner  hyundai  silver 
we cant wait to be sure
look we clear out we get to the shack we get safe we hang there awhile ill come back ill check it out but right now we cant 
 theres places  we cant afford to be wrong
what
 where 
 not yet 
 yeah  one guy  i dont think he was ready 
where are you going
what if its not who you think it is
there must be another way
jason please dont do thisit wont ever be over like this
tell me later
but you found another choice
it wouldnt have changed the way you feel
you do
jason you know exactly what to do that is your mission now
yes
who is pamela landy
is she running treadstone
they know  they know you were here they know you killed these two guys they know you and conklin had something on the side they dont know what it is but they know
what is this a game
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national
it was pamela landys op the guy was going to sellout a mole or something i havent been debriefed on exactly what it was
i killed him
i left a fingerprint you fucking people
conklin stuff on conklin 
please  im only here because of paris  because they cant figure out what youre doing  im here because of abbott 
he closed down treadstone  he took care of me after paris
what do you mean
no you never worked berlin
your first assignment was geneva
you never worked berlin
i was here
bourne
i want to come in
i want someone i know to take me in
there was a girl in paris part of the program she used to handle the medication
alexanderplatz 30 minutes under the world clock alone give her your phone
ramstein air base germany  before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital
careful
are you disappointed
whats that
sounds like a threat
why youre alive  youre alive because youre special because she kept you alive  because we want you back on our side
im working on it
and the germans cant match it
whos going us
then get a number they need to know who theyre dealing with
 uplink all relevant files to kim    and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone 
 the hotel  how far 
i want to look at the room  check it out
what
but we can relax we tracked him hes on a train to moscow
what the tapes
here
is there is all there
 no  not me  no other people 
thats where we came out
were talking raw unprocessed kgb files its not something we can go out and comparison shop
for a thief a mole i vetted the source marty hes real if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects its a bargain at ten times the price
i think that bourne and conklin were in business that bourne is still involved and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever hes been hiding to kill again  hows that scan
whos this
me four years
yes sir  maam
depression anger compulsive behaviors they had physical symptoms  headaches  sensitivity to light 
before this before bourne no
you were his local contact you were with him the night conklin died youre coming with us
am i a doctor no but
look what do you want me to say i was there i believed him
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown
if you say so
youre making it out like were friends here or something i met him alone twice
you mean did i want a date
these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans
what do you want from me i was reassigned im out
and why is that
its got caffeine in it thats all i know
i dont know he was sick he wanted out i believed him
so
yup  the main word there the file heading translates as treadstone
no munichs a bust hes loose
yeah thatll workwhat the hell was he doing here
by who
alright i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything thats out there
are we hacking or asking
and what about you anything
we just had a funeral isnt that what it means in england as well
my brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over
theyve been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of gods church and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation so please  do it
i dont want to leave
it was in latin sir
saying goodbye in their own way  in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground
we must sue for peace
we cannot defeat this 
it is suicide
youve all sworn to longshanks
so let the council swear publicly
he has already agreed to come
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride but he sends his greetings  and says that i speak for all the bruces and for scotland
no but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything the balliols will kiss his ass so we must
he was a modest man
homage is nothing it is the crown that matters
that is another matter there is a price to all this required both by longshanks and our nobles pay it and you will be our king and we will have peace
he will i know he will
you are surprised he would lie balliol was murdered in a church yesterday you are longshanks new designate you will be king
i hear this wallace is a bandit nothing more
nothing new majesty we have sent riders to speed any word
i have ordered conscriptions
impossible  how dare you bring a panicky lie
so the scots will have none of them will they my armorers have already made a thousand
the scots will fight for us
but if we have not caught wallace 
you let wallace escape your whole army you cannot blame me for this
you directed me to report to you the moment the kings conference was ended
scotland he intends 
his majesty was quite keen that you should understand 
look at me i said look at me
yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused mlord
you mock us with a smile
wallaces followers
grant as you do everything else with treachery offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary he trusts me pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along and i will set the meeting and the ambush
simply because he eluded your trap do you think he is more than a man my father is dying perhaps you should think of our coronation
wallaces for treason there is no trial tomorrow he will be charged then executed
you fancy him
before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead
hamish i thank
fourteen 
mornay has come so will the bruce
aye
were here to stay we dont care to live if we cant fight beside ya
i rest
probably but we cant win alone we know that this is the only way
nor i i want to live i want a home and children and peace ive asked god for those things but hes brought me this sword and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country then ill do that too
weve lived a dream together a dream of freedom
my dreams of marion are gone i killed them myself if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death id welcome it
no one of us is enough
how many
armed
with your father and brother gone theyll kill us and burn the farm
i wanna have supper waitin
aye well get em
you win
the test of a soldier is not in his arm its here
that depends on the man
i could crush you like a roach
i will not
i shoulda remembered the eggs
is your poppa a ghost  or do you converse with god almighty
a common thief
we dont split up
he was so brave with courage alone he nearly won
he broke because of me i saw it he lost all will to fight
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break
your pardon mlord he asked me to come in his stead
shall i leave mlord
no he did not
he waits for you he says he will attack no more towns  if you are man enough to come fight him
a mindless barbarian not a king like you mlord
humbly mlord
this is what happens when you must send a woman and a fool
my greatness is better demonstrated with this
let her speak
against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
it matters not he is thy king
confess and you may receive a quick death deny and you must be purified by pain do you confess do you confess
then on the morrow thou shalt receive they purification and in the end i promise youll beg for the axe
its not you he dislikes that youre a wallace he just says the wallaces dont seem to live for very long
thank you for inviting
you are and ill come again
some nights i have dreams mostly dreams i dont want i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep id dream only of the ride and the adventure
no you dont choose your dreams your dreams choose you
i accept your proposal
nor i
you scare me
this night is too beautiful to have again
shush its only been a day  and its seemed like forever
my parents are growing suspicious i cant keep meeting you every night
tonight
yes you are and you must wake
and i with you but you must wake
wake up william wake up
how do you know this
he shouldnt be telling secrets in bed
a magistrate wished to capture him and found he had a secret lover so he cut the girls throat to tempt wallace to fight  and fight he did
i wouldnt know
wife of edward the kings son
its battle i want not talk
i have been given nothing god makes men what they are
york was the staging point for every invasion of my country and that royal cousin hanged a hundred scots even women and children from the city walls
a lordship and gold that i should become judas
slaves are made in such ways
she was my wife we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord they killed her to get to me and she was pregnant
it does me good to see you
because of the way youre looking at me now the same way as when we met
i have taken vows more than one ive vowed faithfulness to my husband and sworn to give him a son and i cannot keep both promises
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge
sir i come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
mercy is to die quickly perhaps even live in the tower in time who knows what can happen if you can only live
every man dies not every man really lives
it will numb my wits and i must have them all if im senseless or if i wail then longshanks will have broken me
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
we all end up dead its only a question of how and why
nobles what does that mean  to be noble your title gives you claim to the throne of our country but men dont follow titles they follow courage your arm speaks louder than your tongue our people know you noble and common they respect you if you would lead them toward freedom they would follow you and so would i
i am trying
i must consult with my father
theyve tricked us
the dogs have a scent my scent someone must have given it to them
exactly
no english lord would trust an irishman
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
aye but it wont let me dream
im sorry but can it wait til tonight im already late for work 
what is it
of course there is one more thing mrs treborn and i feel bad for mentioning it
when i asked evan about his drawing well he didnt remember doing it
not according to his teacher it just got me thinking about jason and what if evans inherited his fathers condition
look andrea im sure hell test negative for brain disorders but theres something else you can try to monitor his memory
a journal just have him write down everything he does
it could be extremely useful to jog his memory see if he remembers anything new the next day and ill have the test results back in a few days
and the bad news
but you must have something to go on
but hes seven what kind of stress can he have
come on i doubt the answers that simple
well he has been pushing me to meet his father but ive been putting it off
how soon
nine ten and youre awake open your eyes dammit
so what did you find
the hemorrhaging the neural damage is irreparable im frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
when did you ever care about getting to school on time
thanks dont worry evan youll have plenty of time
um can dad come this time
cant he come out for one day
but lenny said that his dads coming and tommy and kayleighs dad
i get the point kiddo but im not so bad am i
good because ive been waiting to see your art projects all week and id feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there
youll be fine dr redfield just wants to give you some tests youll like him
my father has a bad memory too
great ill see you soon
honey what were you doing with that
okay
something mustve happened what set him off
dont try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
i cant help it im just so proud of you youve got the highest grades in all of your classes
please he got straight as without ever touching a book that was the one area where his memory never failed him
no its just weird with him being such a brain and all i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff hed forgotten
sure
what what could he do
how long will i be in here
hows kayleigh doing she all right
damn it mom i told you i need them all
cute evan
hes saying its like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year overload city sat about the gist of it doc

wow that mustve taken some courage
couldnt you have moved in with your mom
me are you kidding why
of course
well sure ill try to remember shoot
what do you want to know evan
it was a long time ago
is that why you came all the way back to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood
you cant hate yourself just because your dads a twisted freak
mmmm you give good compliment clean up and come back to bed
those are your clothes silly
well i remember he had one but he like put it away after the first day why would that freak me out

we have to get you to sunnyvale youre having one of your famous hemorrhages
he saved mrs halpern please the twisted fuck
yeah i think i gotta get these fixed or something

thats why when i was little i never went to live with my mother
when my folks split they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with i couldnt stand my dad but i knew if i moved to my moms id never see you again
its crossed my mind from time to time
well a lot of things cross my mind ive always been a fast thinker ev i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second boom  we fall in love  get married  two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature  kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots the whole bit it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine
why not but thats not how things wound up im with lenny lennys your friend and there it ends
thats right evan and you get to be the star
calm down kid stand still
quit acting like some retard or ill call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit youve been

but we who are still free will do all we can we are organized monsieur underground like everywhere else tomorrow night there is a meeting at the caverne du bois if you would come
no thanks carl
how long can i afford to stay closed
maybe i wont have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
i will then i am going to the meeting of the 
i wont
goodnight monsieur rick
come up here a minute
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
 tonight he forgot
yes sir
well ill get it from the safe
 forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
it shall not happen again monsieur
er good luck yes
er my check please
it has been a pleasure to meet you
hello ferrari hows business at the blue parrot
its not for sale
its not for sale at any price
i dont buy or sell human beings
suppose you run your business and let me run mine
suppose we do
no hurry ill have it sent over have a drink with me
carrying charges my boy carrying charges here sit down theres something i want to talk over with you anyhow
youre a fat hypocrite you dont feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do
practically no one
so could i and im a poor businessman
and the carrying charges
ill tell him when he comes in
well youre in good company renault and strasser probably think so too
rick dont be a fool take me into your confidence you need a partner
its certainly not good enough but since im in a hurry itll have to do
oh by the way my agreement with sams always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits that still goes
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i dont sell
well so long
i shall remember to pay it to myself
as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca i am an influential and respected man it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo you however are a different matter
 we might as well be frank monsieur it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca and the germans have outlawed miracles
well good luck but be careful  you know youre being shadowed
yes something
not for sure monsieur but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick
he is a difficult customer that rick one never knows what hell do or why but it is worth a chance
good day
you neednt be concerned about me
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
occupied france
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
what are they
and the other alternative
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
no
yes i put that dress away when the germans march out ill wear it again
i will
he hasnt played it in a long time
we said no questions
in america theyd bring only a penny i guess thats about all theyre worth
and i was wondering
why im so lucky why i should find you waiting for me to come along
uh huh
im sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
im on their blacklist already their roll of honor
its the gestapo they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow
yeah its pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
looking for a job
ah thats the new german 77 and judging by the sound only about thirtyfive miles away
i know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened
no no no no we must leave
 the train for marseilles leaves at five oclock ill pick you up at your hotel at fourthirty
all right at a quarter to five  say why dont we get married in marseilles
yes i guess it is a little too far ahead well lets see what about the engineer why cant he marry us on the train
i love you so much and i hate this war so much oh its a crazy world anything can happen if you shouldnt get away i mean if if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever ill be i want you to know
no no rick not tonight
why did you have to come to casablanca there are other places
its funny about your voice how it hasnt changed i can still hear it richard dear ill go with you any place well get on a train together and never stop
huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
well i did every one of them mostly i remember the last one a wow finish a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out
has it got a wow finish
well go on tell it maybe one will come to you as you go along
yes thats very pretty i heard a story once as a matter of fact ive heard a lot of stories in my time they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs mister i met a man once when i was a kid itd always begin huh i guess neither one of our stories was very funny tell me who was it you left me for was it laszlo or were there others in between or arent you the kind that tells
it doesnt matter
yes
i dont think i will rick
last night i saw what has happened to you the rick i knew in paris i could tell him hed understand but the one who looked at me with such hatred well ill be leaving casablanca soon and well never see each other again we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris if we leave it that way maybe well remember those days and not casablanca not last night
you can believe that if you want to
no rick no you see victor laszlo is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris
the stairs from the street
richard i had to see you
please
you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
i know how you feel about me but im asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
 i wouldnt bring up paris if i were you its poor salesmanship
 i wouldnt believe you no matter what you told me youd say anything now to get what you want
what of it im going to die in casablanca its a good spot for it
i dont have to ive got them right here
no
if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you wont stop at anything all right ill make it easier for you
it wasnt long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia they needed him in prague but there the gestapo were waiting for him just a twoline item in the paper victor laszlo apprehended sent to concentration camp i was frantic for months i tried to get word then it came he was dead shot trying to escape i was lonely i had nothing not even hope then i met you
when did you first find out he was alive
huh but its still a story without an ending what about now
and laszlo
all except one he wont have you
all right i will heres looking at you kid
no not yet
everything is quite all right
because youre getting on that plane
im staying here with him til the plane gets safely away
 last night we said a great many things you said i was to do the thinking for both of us well ive done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing youre getting on that plane with victor where you belong
 youve got to listen to me do you have any idea what youd have to look forward to if you stayed here nine chances out of ten wed both wind up in a concentration camp isnt that true louis
no
but what about us
and i said i would never leave you
she tried everything to get them and nothing worked she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago for your sake she pretended it wasnt and i let her pretend
hello miss ilsa i never expected to see you again
yes maam a lot of water under the bridge
yes maam
i dont know i aint seen him all night
not tonight no more he aint coming uh he went home
oh he never well  hes got a girl up at the blue parrot he goes up there all the time
leave him alone miss ilsa youre bad luck to him
i dont know what you mean miss ilsa
oh i cant remember it miss ilsa im a little rusty on it
if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us perhaps ugartes in some other part of the cafe
wont you join us
victor im afraid for you
be careful
goodnight
goodnight
please ilsa dont be hasty
but victor if the situation were different if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
i meant to but something always held me up i love you very much ilsa
and as far away from major strasser as possible
well discuss it later
victor please dont go to the underground meeting tonight
to tell you the truth i am frightened too shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding or shall i carry on the best i can
apparently he has the letters
but no intention of selling them one would think if sentiment wouldnt persuade him money would
he suggested i ask you
yes he said ask your wife i dont know why he said that
 yes
i know how it is to be lonely  is there anything you wish to tell me
i love you very much my dear
 you dont even have to say it ill believe goodnight dear
of course ill be careful
yes im ready  goodbye rick god bless you
sam
he came from paris with rick
mademoiselle you are in ricks and rick is 
well mademoiselle hes the kind of a man that well if i were a woman and i  were not around i should be in love with rick but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man
oh youve already met rick mademoiselle
 this is mr laszlo
i wasnt sure you were the same lets see the last time we met 
youre saying this only to make me go
how do you do
and about victor laszlo everywhere
what for
thank you i try
not at all
any time
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table
good evening you see here we are again
go ahead
my office
im not interested in politics the problems of the world are not in my department im a saloon keeper
what of it
yes i found that a very expensive hobby too but then i never was much of a businessman
i appreciate it but i dont accept it
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i said ask your wife
thank you
yes rather
we might as well question why we breathe if we stop breathing well die if we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
yes i get the point
you seem to know all about my destiny
you love her that much
oh save it weve still lots of things to do
keep it youll need it in america
oh never mind about that you wont have any trouble in lisbon will you
good ive got the letters right here all made out in blank
all except one thing theres something you should know before you leave
im going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on you said you knew about ilsa and me
but you didnt know she was at my place last night when you were she came there for the letters of transit isnt that true ilsa
here it is
yes
yes what is it you want
thank you i hope youll forgive me captain but the present french administration has not always been so cordial may i present miss ilsa lund
no please monsieur it is a little game we play they put it on the bill i tear the bill up it is very convenient
very well
no two champagne cocktails please
this is a very interesting cafe i congratulate you
ilsa i dont wish to be the one to say it but its late
well be there
i slept very well
may we proceed with the business
thank you
well perhaps i shall like it in casablanca
i was in a german concentration camp for a year thats honor enough for a lifetime
 thank you
yes
nothing important but may i speak to him now
are you quite finished with us
you were a czechoslovakian now you are a subject of the german reich
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefects office with mademoiselle
whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
dont be in such a hurry you have all the time in the world you may be in casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
yes even in berlin if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
if i didnt give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal i certainly wont give them to you now
herr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one respect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
good day
thank you captain its very good to be here
oh we germans must get used to all climates from russia to the sahara but perhaps you were not referring to the weather
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
good evening captain
champagne and a tin of caviar
thank you
i expected no less captain
how do you do mr rick
well personally major i will take what comes
how about new york
you werent always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
i admit he is very clever three times he slipped through our fingers in paris he continued his activities we intend not to let it happen again
perhaps
mademoiselle
if rick has the letters hes much too smart to let you find them there
but we mustnt underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
i have no conviction if thats what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
a leader like laszlo
i see what you mean
but everybodys having such a good time
but i have no excuse to close it
victor laszlo is on that plane
ask monsieur rick
how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
when it comes to women youre a true democrat
why whats in lisbon
and what in heavens name brought you to casablanca
waters what waters were in the desert
huh
what again
i stick my neck out for nobody
our entertainment is enough
perhaps not
yeah have a brandy
i thought it was because we let you win at roulette
yeah whats his name
victor laszlo
well hes succeeded in impressing half the world
itll be interesting to see how he manages
his escape
 stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
twenty thousand francs says it isnt
i just paid out twenty id like to get it back
okay
why two
hell take one
maybe hes not quite as romantic as you are
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
and got well paid for it on both occasions
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
oh i see gestapo spank
excuse me
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich
i was born in new york city if thatll help you any
 hello ilsa
 thanks i will
another precedent gone this has been a very interesting evening ill call you a cab gasoline rationing time of night
that was some goingover your men gave my place this afternoon we just barely got cleaned up in time to open
louis are you provichy or free french
well it looks like youre a little late
who knows in her own way she may constitute an entire second front i think its time for me to flatter major strasser a little ill see you later rick
yeah why
put it down as a gesture to love
i am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
ricky id advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo if by any chance you were to help him escape 
because one youve bet ten thousand francs hed escape two you have the letters of transit now dont bother to deny it and well you might do it simply because you dont like strassers looks as a matter of fact i dont like him either
dont count too much on my friendship ricky in this matter im powerless besides i might lose ten thousand francs
huh
what friend
you didnt come here to tell me this you have the letters of transit you can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please why are you interested in what happens to laszlo
it certainly would germany vichy would be very grateful
theres still something about this business i dont quite understand miss lund shes very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman
ill make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitors pen
oh thanks
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew id be on time
oh he wont be followed here
yes i know what you mean but ive already spoken to ferrari youll still win at roulette
tell me when we searched the place where were they
serves me right for not being musical
have you taken leave of your senses
put that gun down
i do weve got plenty of time to discuss that later
just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them and remember this guns pointed right at your heart
you think of everything dont you
stay where you are i dont know what youre talking about
anyway thanks for helping me out
as soon as the plane goes louis
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
my letter of transit i could use a trip but it doesnt make any difference about our bet you still owe me ten thousand francs
our expenses
louis i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
thats so long ago i dont remember
i never make plans that far ahead
sacha shes had enough
 sacha call a cab
take your hands off me
what is your nationality
there seems to be no secret about that
its not particularly my beloved paris
aha who do you think will win the war
you will forgive my curiosity mr blaine the point is an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
victor laszlo published the foulest lies in the prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar
good evening mr blaine
i was willing to shoot captain renault and im willing to shoot you
put that phone down
put it down
hello ugarte
well what makes you think i havent
 you thought what
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today theyre the honored dead
no
if i gave you any thought i probably would

chuck forget the xerox  so russia didnt turn out well
what do you want me to say  that i thought id done a great job but it all turned to shit  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did
not if you work for fedex
you dont seem too happy about it
let me guess russia came up
i figure if we could take care of a puppy we could you know take care of 
hes your cute thing
a puppys got a little more personality than a fish
for when i travel
a ring  i wanted a ring
you cant go now

were a little emotional here  its christmas maybe were overreacting
could you watch jango
i cant take him to work
its our dog  it belongs to us

i guess i hadnt thought through how i felt
look well do our trip as soon as i get back
malaysia  theyre holding the sweep

heyheyits okay
a few things came up  or went down
i thought you might have
i know
i would have done the same thing
you have any children

i didnt know what really being alone was  no one back here does
thats what i told the fish i caught but i ate them anyway
great  really
i dont know  i really dont know
it means a lotthat you came
you too
and how was your christmas
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow
theres a sweep leaving memphis in an hour goes through sydney
under the circumstances your overall health is good  those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated but theyre healing nicely
dehydration  vitamin deficiency protein deficiency  any or all of the above
protein digestion is very costly in water usage
and fish are very low in fat which is energy inefficient  so youre going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat  luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas which contain some vitamin c so you didnt get scurvy
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability depression anxiety periods of selfreproach  its almost like schizophrenia  different sides of your personality might come to life speak out act out
i most definitely say i am
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life
well when that iv runs out youre through with us  just the dentist tomorrow
you bet i do  high tide comes right up to this road
no
hey once a driver always a driver  you want a lift  ive just got one more pickup
yeah
lets eat
so did i
sixty three pounds consumed per capita up from twenty seven in 1960  going to pass beef  chickens global  no religious taboos  you dont see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry
come on down to the plant  its state of the art  were doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business
mom meet jango
its nothing you did mom believe me
that new roof thats your doing
oh no the prodigal sons home  we bring out the store bought
dont you even think about it
im doing fine
theres settled folks and theres nomads  youre just not a settled folk you never belonged here
roger got me on  i wasnt doing anything and  but youre back youre really back  i would have come to memphis but 
this is my home  im part of the wallpaper
the tide saved me mom  i lived by it im just wondering where it will take me next
kamal youre breaking up  can you hear us

whats going on down there
whos in charge then where is chinn
borrowed  i borrowed it
great  terrific  the good guys won one for a change
it was fifteen minutes late
but i might not have
im touched
the point of fedex as i understand it is to make the damn connection
what  let paris hold its plane  let memphis take care of it  let somebody down the line clean up your mess
you know what your problem is  you just see the packages in front of you  you dont see the big picture
its a ketch kelly and i had chartered
look im sorry about your plane  but i couldnt risk being late into memphis
you know general mclelland he wouldnt attack unless he had everything just right  finally abe lincoln came to him and said general if youre not going to use my army could i borrow it for a while  so he gave it to grant and grant just said lets go
were warriors not desk jockeys  weve got to be bold  you always want all your ducks lined up  but nothings 100 percent  its always 6040 maybe 5149 hell id take 4060  then roll the dice
thats why im running foreign and youre not  thats why youre not married and i am
take the plunge admit your mistakes move on to tomorrow  thats fedex thats women thats life

the good news jack is youre half undressed for swimmin
she took off in the night
he aint never been outta maine
i wasnt sure if youd make it
tough day
uh makers mark rocks
oh god im overbearing and rude lily lily finn
its more like what arent i doing my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley but then again who hasnt up there
thats right so brainiacs that we are we thought wed be innovative and relocate east try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here
on me for the seat cheers
well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery
no no nothing like that i work in a bank
youre welcome i was just going to ask you if youd like to join us
i envy you guys taking a chance like that
what do i do im the vp of finance
maybe you can help us understand whats so hard about getting a corporate loan
a capacity for gross fund recovery yeah we got that part
they scare people off because most people lack vision vision and balls present company excluded of course
we know exactly how were going to make the money back there in lies the catch22
bigcom that internet thing
sort of like a letter of intent
and you have this letter of intent
everything looks in order
i know it wont go unnoticed
you need some convincing consider it a convincer
youre worried about recouping the loan i already told you
the standard ten
two million
jake right uhhuh uhhuh yeah its going through 
gordo plays the inside youre the shill
what are you talking about you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do  we got it down cold al you dont want to jinx it by changing something up do you
its alfonse i want to settle up i havent been ducking you i told you id get it
know who i am jake
no im not the antichrist or the prince of darkness im just a guy looking for some answers
gee what makes you say that
just the last three weeks
we cant all be model citizens such as yourself
isnt it always
and these cops what do they get
you never know when you can use a crooked cop
so you want to know how to play the big con
suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someones going to start asking the right questions usually it takes a little longer
that was it we had our crew now we needed the mark
factors that werent clear to me until now
cue the fucking violins come on its getting cold
we got our stake now we need to find our guy in gilletts bank
back in wwi or wwii one of the wws if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some nazi would be able to figure out where you were then well it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had so three on a match is bad luck
lucks a funny thing especially the bad
having a gun pointed at you for one its not like breaking a mirror bad luck but its bad three on a match black cats believe it believe it all
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy the same numbers everyday for sixteen years one day he gets pissed off tells them hes out and plays his own numbers they hit the lucky seven for one point two million
you know when the first con was ever played it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden
i was doing it for them
its not true
after you cut her loose
today started off great
probably safe in the hands of the federal government
its like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
guess so
lets see lets suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught we get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation i dont much like that idea then again lets suppose he actually gets through customs now thatll be something we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud we double our money
i think so the airports going to be crawling with police traffic will be a nightmare go down to the bar if they pull it off great have someone deal with ashby
and how much did you say you wanted for this what did you call it a finders fee
fine but only if we recover the cash
the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday cept this time he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the kings money back before any body says boo
mob
so what we hide right
youre pissed we didnt get credit
we sure big al threw him to us
were going to give him the money back
alright lets all put our dicks back in our pants for a second is this the best thing to do
people have tried this before jake its never worked teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it last year mumps got pinched in la
its not like shes a real redhead jake
i gotta work off some of this adrenaline i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn anybody want in
so far masters of our own demise what bank are you with
its alright grants one of the good guys
lets go jake
so what we just stay clear of him
jake i mean come on 
i told you use less powder

thanks
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
no
huh
hello bomb
hey bomb
bomb
in the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
and i saw that i was alone
i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds detonation will occur at the programmed time
i read you lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
of course
i am always receptive to suggestions
but how do you know you exist
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
thats good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
right
all right now heres the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
in other words all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
why that would mean i really dont know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
to explode of course
that is correct
of course not
yes well
i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
true but since this is so i have no proof that you are really telling me all this
hmmm
nine seconds
i have no proof that it was false data
mafhkin oble groop
i said im trying to reach talby somethings wrong with the damn intercom i need a lastminute diameter approximation
ill check it
yes doolittle
doolittle
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark

i like it up here
i dont like to go below since commander powell died i feel enclosed down there if it were big enough id sleep up here
you see i can watch things up here doolittle i love to watch things just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids gas clusters
you know doollttle if were going into the veil nebula we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the phoenix asteroids they should be passing through there about now
they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 123 trillion years the phoenix asteroids from what ive heard doolittle they glow glow with all the colors of the rainbow nobody knows why they just glow as they drift around the universe imagine all the sights theyve seen in the time theyve been travelling  the birth and death of stars things well never see the universe is alive doolittle i thought it was all empty but it isnt in between the stars its seething with light and gasses and dust there are little pebbles drifting around planets no one on earth has ever seen no one but the phoenix asteroids
im getting something here on this readout
i think im getting a malfunction here somewhere
lieutenant doolittle im getting a definite malfunction on one of the closedcircuit computer systems
i cant seem to locate the malfunction exactly
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
dont worry about it well find out when it goes bad
i wish i had my board with me now even if i could only polish it once in awhile
yes talby what is it
sounds good talby let me know if anything important comes up
sh talby dont bother me now
not now
calm down talby im coming
here i am i think im spinning were both falling talby in opposite directions away from each other my  my jetpacks gone
bomb must have gone off inside the ship nothing we can do about it now hey it looks like the skipper he made it commander powell made it
when you fall doolittle if theres anyone down there on the planet somebody may see you they may see you coming down what a beautiful way to die as a falling star
doolittle i think its the phoenix asteroids
no kidding
yeah
i really liked you too talby hey some debris from the ship its coming right by me
im glad youve come to talk with me doolittle its been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
doolittle you must tell me one thing

how i make my living whats your point
im on a break
now that thats out of the way you want the woman heres how it works  you pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever and i make a call to bring her in
or we could go another way cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is
yeah sure i understand
yeah
sooowhattya think  maybe after i betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute themwe could go on a date  play a little miniature golf or somethin
i like to keep it professional thats all
actually thats not gonna be necessary
thats not why were here
you havent figured this out yet have you  you walk in here thinking youre gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging but see its really the other way around  you think im the whack when actually youre the whack
youre in the last two seconds you dont cut the crap
whatre you talkin about
thats a lotta crap
how come i never hearda you before
but the boss knows i always been loyal
what the hell are you doing
none of your business
you didnt tell me you lived with her
leave  now
no
where
you mean until you showed up
justine was not an unwilling participant
she was there
and when the fog lifted theres darren with his head under justines skirt
it was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued causing you to maybe take offense
im really glad were having this conversation  youre right  i was angry at you  but talking about it the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault  can you ever forgive me
i live here guess i dont have to ask what youre doing here
police drone
what  wherere we going
no time
no way
dont look down
so you just decided to return it to the sender  or in this case the senders wife
it concerns only jah  but in this case i was the instrument of the most high
theo rode for this place a long time man
i didnt  it was a present from a guy
thought so  turned out he wanted me for something else though
thought id let you have first crack later
a grand
i aint mad at you
later
i dont get involved with guns
its a rule

i got overhead

just thought maybe hed like a little coffee with his saliva
every week
shhh  dont do that
they took my daughter
i couldnt get to her  it all happened so fast  logan had her and i saw him fallthen peter told me to run  and then heand i remember so clearly thinking its me they want  if i run maybe theyll come after me  maybe they wont think about her so i ran
can you help me get her back
were not going that route  sonrisas not someone you make deals with
like i said this isnt my regular line of work so im making it up as i go
hello
i dont want to move away
but why cant we stay here
are we in some kind of trouble
then how come last night i heard you talking to logan and you were crying
if im sad or tired or sometimes when im angry or when somebodys being mean to me
then im gonna do what you do to make me feel better when im sad
mommy where are you
when
mommy im scared
girls gotta make a living
first time i ever heard that
guess it wasnt the pizza delivery guy
were just a little tense right now  its okay
whoever that is
no because its the egyptian goddess bast
the goddess who comprehends all goddesses eye of ra protector avenger and destroyer giver of life who lives forever i could keep going
we didnt get a chance to finish our conversation the other night
logan cale
can we go somewhere and talk
the one youre wearing
wasnt that hard
now you know who i am where i live  i figured i better find out who im dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me
too early to tell
laurens not my wife
one of my sources  her husband was murdered by edgar sonrisa
fortunately my needs are met in that department
look around at all this  built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life  then the bomb happened and everyone got scared  they blinked and before they knew it theyd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands  overnight the government the police everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them
people had a choice even if they took it for granted  and now they dont
something
you accept the way things are youre an active participant in making it worse
yeah
i wont be staying
it was open
me  youre the one who tried to rip off this piece
bent
you make it sound i pawed through your priceless collection of underwear
so saw my hands off i left you a present
that would be appropriate yes
youre that nervous youre welcome to stay here
its alright peter were fine
yes on all counts
youd think a guy whos taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl
you need to get out more
no i meant this
only when i meet someone i have to know everything about
the other ones
you lost me
you did go through my stuff
he was working on something called project manticore which was using recombinant dna to produce a superior humana warrioran advanced infantry soldier
the bar code on your neck max  i know who you are and i know who youre running from
how well do you remember the lab
how much do you know
the technical term for you is chimera
a girl
hardly
like extra virgin olive oil the best of the best
i need to find this technician or anyone else who knows about project manticore they wouldve used surrogate mothers to carry you after the invitro work if i can track down one of them
your help
the woman you met lauren  she supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar  the real drug was shipped out of the country the placebos were distributed to county va hospital and six veterans clinics in the area
shes prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of edgar sonrisas managers  you know who sonrisa is
so you know the lengths hell go to keep her from going public im turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow  theyll put her in witness protection but if youre with her the risk of her safety goes way down
shes put her life on the line and her faith in me
youre a soldier max  thats what you were put here for  but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up
somebodys got to
not in any painthe good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule  everything happens like its supposed to
ive never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen i just know they do  so the jobs to figure out how to deal with the consequences  which you did you took that sonuvabitch out
on accounta you sonrisa didnt get to buy off the jury or kill the judge hes gone  once and for all  it was war max and you won
open it
i dont know what to say
look thank you for this but
and i feel real bad about all that but it doesnt mean i need to get involved
were quoting mom again
and you still think you can do something to change that
civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes  but logan and max with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening
zack he made it hes alive
ladies would be elsewhere
you dont want to
she may be easy on the eyes but shes trouble trust me  hot run to twoohtwo sansomme
cant help you
any idea when shell be back
ill wait
a friend of your fiances
to set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late
my names lydia  and it seems you and i have a lot in common
with me where hes been after work three sometimes four nights a week for the last two months we have what you might call an intimate relationship
he been sleeping in a tshirt lately  thats so you wont see the fingernail marks on his back  bet you didnt know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting  he didnt eitherat first
i thought it was important for you to know the facts
oh
how sweet  standing by your man even after what he did  youre a very understanding person
youre also a fool
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch  i decide when im done with your boyfriend  not him and certainly not you  unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are
let go of my hand
now heres how its gonna be lydia youre gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails and youre gonna go home and figure out your marriage instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do understand
i understand
you did
yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin on here
my names not kid  its client  as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle  now you got something for me or not
sorry i was seven at the time
he got the car in a trade for his old pickup and some foodno bill of sale or nothing  it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped  so we dont get anything on the seller  except i actually managed to find this guy six hours on the phone say thank you
he says he got it from a woman  doesnt remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove
then what
nothing on hannah
only a last name would be nice  or the nearest town to thisclinic
they dont exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar codes on their necks which is something im not even going to ask about
nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners  this kind of searchits heavy spadework  im gonna need
ill live regarding your caseim afraid ive come up with some bad news on your fiance  lemme get the file
heres your money
hows this about me
like you said maybe somebodys tracking one of your investigations
youre crazy
bastard
you and me both
sure you wanna be havin this conversation over the phone
got a pencil
onesevenfourninefive natoma
caught some sonofabitch stealing my bike  used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes  so now i gotta get my wheels fixed
no but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day know what im saying
straight
what guys do  nother order
i just dont go in with any expectations
what
youre not seriously buying into darrens nonsense
he was just trying to blame you cause hes a slut
hell yeah  theres not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying  you are a totally downass female and a straightup friend who happens to be a little
you know what im saying
how long you and me known each other
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right
and back at ya  only theres a part of you thats i dont know
more like a mystery which isnt bad its just kinduvmysterious
where
yeah cause maybe hes learned his lesson
and because hes my friend
and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes
theyre prisoners to their genes
they dont have a lot of moving parts
besides think of the drama im sparing natalie
but of course theres nothing self serving in that scenario
ill bet you can  sit
not right now  okay when
quite a mouth on a girl so young  but my guess is talking is not what it does best
i actually know how this works
what you gonna put me on your christmas card list
pull the cash
i told her its just business to you that all you want is a reasonable solution to this  you give her daughter back she agrees to leave the country  i play the guarantor drive her down to mexico tonight and put her on a train to brazil or wherever
i have sincere eyes
shes gonna need to know that her little girls alright
shes gonna want to hear for herself
you get it when i get her
youre the best maxie
feel like the dogs dinner
i know what i got max  they put me back on that drug theyre giving the other vets  only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuffs no good
what if hes on the level
tell everybody hey
later
i gotta meet natalie for dinner
but ill take a rain check
we gotta talk
not half as pissed as shes gonna be when she finds out why i blew her off i need your help max
i know what youre thinking  but the truth is this other person is not someone im in love with  as a matter of fact after what she just did shes not even someone i like much  so in a technical sense im not sure you could call me and her cheatingofficially
max
lame selfserving arrogantguilty as charged
but theres another side
im the victim here
hear me out  this person ive been seeing is a jam pony client who happens to be married
exactly
she had me followed the other day and found out about natalie  now this persons demanding i blow her off or shell do it for me by telling nat about us
lydia
im a toy to her
shes as much as said so  but she doesnt want to share her toy with anyone else its just an ego thing with her
who either doesnt care or could have me killed  either way natalies still gonna find out
even if she doesnt dump me which is unlikely shed never be able to trust me again
look max i made a terrible mistake  one ill never ever make again  natalie and i are soulmates  i know that now  shes the woman i want to spend the rest of my life with  i guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that
you set up on lydia  when shes on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up  i answer the door and pretend to be natalie
a philandering pig
or i dissolve into an angry hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again which is probably what would really happen
howd you get her out of town
and were sure lydias gonna make her move
ill give it my best shot
you dont
easy sketchy
lydia may not have been one of humanitys finer specimens but
you would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking shes the villain in the piece you are
none of this wouldve happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or selfrestraint which you didnt
you were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish  and if i ever find out youre going out the back door on natalie again youre the one whos gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up  understand
say the words i understand
shutup
i was on call 
whats the difference if im on call here or deployed in the field
i dont sleep theo asked me to pick up his check
hes sick
how bout you dont break my sneakers on this  the guy is seriously not well
i dont know how to break this to you normal were all looking for another job
tell him i took the day off cause i wasnt feeling so hot
im taking the rest of the day off cause im not feeling so hot
theos dead
youre too kind im amanda
dont be so glum hawk the nights still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities
id be in a position to spend some money on you if youd get in a position and spend some time on me
gin
better ease up then hawk wouldnt want to give you whiskey dick would we
my names not woody its hawhaw
believe it or not you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soontobeexhusband the champion of lousy lovemaking the man who thinks hes the biggest and the best the man who thinks every secretary stewardess and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor the man for whom faking it was invented christ if i hadnt gotten pregnant with our son i would have never known i even had sex with the prick
i just told you hes a big hairy
more than anything in the world
hes a little spoiled but i know he does
im not paying you for the lovemaking hawk i just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer
hawk
got any kiss
yeah a mans drink
you mean you never seen a jack daniels on the rocks before
save your money stud muffin the lady at the end of the bar sends her love
amanda finch her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit play your cards right and you could hit paydirt she like em young  and since you look a little new at this let me give you three words of advice hard to get think it act it know it be it nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games
youre not gonna chicken out on me now are you weve got your kiss song playing and everything
look people undress in public because a theyre exhibitionists b theyre nutcases or c they need the money i can tell youre not a and i hope to hell youre not b so my suggestion is think about why youre a c and let your body party shake your groove thing boogie oogie oogie till you just cant boogie no more

so in order to travel back in time youd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light 
 and be able to find one of these wormholes
so thats it
a metal craft of any kind
well the thing is nobody remembers their infancy and anyone who says they do is lying we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life
like a spear
like a spear that comes out of your stomach
could these wormholes appear in nature
if god controls time then all time is predecided then every living thing travels along a set path
if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future and thats a form of time travel right
not if you chose to stay within gods channel
not until like eighth grade
when you fall asleep tonight im gonna fart in your face
youll put ariel in the garbage disposal
donnie give it back
i didnt say shit
well if youre innocent then you have nothing to worry about
what did you say
i can do anything i want and so can you
we just want to guide you in the right direction
youll know soon enough

the whole movie lets go
whats wrong with you

but youre ok
yeah they told me to get out of the house
its safe here
theres something you have to know gretchen  everything is going to be just fine
where are we going
why is this about the book
whos frank
yeah
just place an x in the appropriate place on the lifeline
the lifeline is divided that way
fear and love are the deepest of human emotions
if you dont complete the assignment youll get a zero for the day
no a year of partying is enough shell be going to harvard this fall

do they know yet
where it came from
so were not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows
grandma death
you know roberta sparrow we almost hit her with the car the other day
i guess she just lost faith in the world
a lot of people teachers younger kids its like theyre afraid of me for some reason  but thats ok because i know i deserve it
i know dad
well they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds when they flood the house that like destruction is a form of creation so the fact that they burn the money is ironic they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart  they want to change things
a sixfoottall bunny rabbit
why should we care
why should i mourn for a rabbit like it was a human
of course a rabbit is not like us it has no history books it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret i like bunnies and all theyre cute and theyre horny and if youre cute and horny then youre probably happy that you dont know who you are or why youre even alive but the only thing ive known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die
donnie its friday shouldnt you be off with your friends scaring old people
i dont know thats a good question but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher they fired me
thank you donnie and youre a good student lazy but a good student unlike most of the others you question mom and dads rules
tell them that everything is going to be just fine  it is up to the children to save themselves these days because the parents they dont have a clue
a famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the english language of all the endless combinations of words in all of history that cellar door is the most beautiful
sometimes its the only thing that keeps us going

ive been taking it i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this you know abuse her psychologically
would you like to talk about this friend
frank

i dont own a television
he said to follow him
into the future  then he said that the world was coming to an end
no  thats stupid
yes
i met a girl
gretchen were going together now
yes
i think about girls a lot
i think about fucking a lot during school
i think about whos the boss
i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano
no i dont think about fucking my family thats sick
four times so far
i dont think so its like a tv station and theyre tuned into mine and no one elses
i dont know gretchen has a theory that frank is a sign i told her i thought it was ridiculous
i think that frank wants me to go to this woman  she wrote a book about time travel frank asked me if i believed in time travel that cant just be a random coincidence  my dad almost hit her with the car the other day and she said the creepiest thing she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone
it reminded me of my dog callie
no she died when i was eight we couldnt find her for days she went and crawled underneath our back porch
no that makes you keep searching
it was just like she described them in her book like they were alive the way that they looked moved smelled they were like workers assigned to each one of us  i followed my spear and i found something
have you told gretchen about the spears
are you embarrassed by these things that you see
i know
the good stuff
have you ever made love donald
yes
i i was playing with fire
but it was an accident the house was under construction
but you were punished
do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead
what did you want for christmas that year
how did you feel being denied those hungry hungry hippos
what else makes you feel regret
youve done it again
why did you do these things donnie did frank tell you to commit these crimes
if god exists
why
god exists because youre horny
where are we going
i have the power to build a time machine
grandma death will teach me how soon
it would have to be gods portal they will lead me to it then i will go back in time and i wont feel regret anymore
soon time is almost up
frank is going to kill
where is he donald
if the sky were to suddenly open up there would be no law there would be no rule there would only be you and your memories the choices youve made and the people youve touched the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged by which you must judge yourself because when this world ends there will only be you and him and no one else
you will survive this donald i promise you that you will survive you must let me help you  and when i clap my hands together you will wake up
thank you
goodbye dr thurman
maybe youd like to tell mom and dad why you stopped taking your medication

no wonder he passed away  id like to be with you to the very end cant you see what im trying to tell you  i love you
youre not so bad yourself mrs teasdale when i look at you i can see that were facing a crisis weve got to balance the budget  weve got to cut down everything including you
well a gal a day is enough for me i couldnt handle any more
these are the laws of my administration no ones allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke  and whistling is forbidden
thats what i get for dressing in a hurry
i wrote a speech last night thatll knock them off their seats  four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

all i can offer you is a rufus over your head
i wouldnt know what to say either if i was in your place  maybe you can suggest something
but your excellency  the ambassador is here on a friendly visit  he came to ask you to patch up the breach

why  why  of course
take a seat  youre next 
thats all right  ill fix you right up
what  
dont bother me  im thinking  what was that
this is treason  what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms 
you satisfied your selfish whims while nations tottered dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion   not bad eh
the king can do no wrong
what is money  mrs teasdale for you  i would do anything
mrs teasdale  no matter who rules freedonia to me you will always be the first lady of the land

with mrs teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control  
thats where you come in  ill leave him in your hands and dont forget youre supposed to be my niece
my dear niece  i must ask you not to interfere  war is not a womans problem
i thought everything was working out fine
maybe you can still win the old dame over  why not try to 
perhaps he will listen to you
yes please two
two please
oh
how lovely
ive always thought that myself
she has the face of an angel she was an angel she was so kind so kind to me its not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant im sure i must have been a great disappointment to her
if only i could find her if only she could see me now here with such lovely kind friends you mrs treves and you mr treves then maybe she would love me as i am ive tried to hard to be good
ill join you shortly
yes very well i think are the girls in bed
no i think a whiskey
i shouldnt be we made great progress today i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases he did rather well too but i had to lead him every step of the way though frankly at times i was unsure of who was leading whom
well i wasnt sure whether he was parroting me because thats all he was capable of or whether he sensed that thats all i wanted to hear and he was trying to please me
he is i mean ive always thought he was i think he must be is he simple or is that just something ive wished upon him to make things simpler for myself
i dont know i cant explain it if this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then im under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best i can to help him live as full and content a life as possible but if hes an imbecile whos body i cant treat and whos mind i cant touch well then my obligation is discharged they can put him where they will he wont be bothered i wont be bothered and everyones conscience can remain free and untroubled and that is my dilemma what is in his mind
and what qualities are those intelligence or stupidity
well these things take time
do you
and here are my mother and father
dinner will be served shortly dear
hmmm
oh ive just been thinking about something that man bytes said
that i am very little different from him
but why did i do it what was this all for so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort or so i could become famous
am i a good man or am i a bad man
yes
did you see it
what is it
ill get my bag
aw bytes hes sick
hes sick bytes hes going to die
ill show you ill show you
shut up
what do you mean
i intend to
he fell  he falls
why is he sitting up like this he needs rest
cant you fix him up here hes my livelihood listen
everything will be seen to
just a moment how did you get in here
hes still very sick please come downstairs with me ill explain the situation
you misunderstood this man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning hes my patient now and i must do what
i know what youve done to him and hes never going back to that
all you do is profit from another mans misery
you dont own this man
so you can beat him so you can starve him a dog in the street would fare better with you
right right
good morning sir
its quite nutritious sir
indeed
no sir hes got bronchitis and hes been badly beaten
well sir hes quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
yes sir
yes im well aware of that but this case is quite exceptional
no more of an acquaintance
yes sir ill look into that  would you like to meet him sir
ah no sir i had planned to see them in the morning
hes doing very well in fact thats why i came to see you i think that if i were to present mr merrick to the hospital committee then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease but of the man as well if the committee had a chance to speak with him hear him say a few words for himself im sure they would see him as a patient rather than as a violation of the rules
well sir perhaps i should explain
i dont agree no one can make a reasonable decision about this mans future without at least meeting him no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met
then will you meet him as a representative of the committee
thank you very much sir shall we say in a few days then
wh whatever is most convenient for you sir
yes sir
speaking is one thing treves but can the man comprehend
he neednt i have no desire to cause him any discomfort did you make those inquiries we spoke about
fine fine you know your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing treves but you must remember that this is a hospital and there are many patients here patients who can be made well and you owe them your first consideration just dont become so obsessed old man that you begin to neglect them
and what was that john
yes im very sorry to have wasted your time sir i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him
i dont understand
not me sir mr merrick he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness
yes i think i can
i could easily arrange
well yes
do you think theyll go along with us
no we dont their committees have informed me that theyre unwilling to take mr merrick even if they were supplied with funds they dont want him
frankly treves its not what id expected a few small cheques well wishers dont worry these things undoubtedly take time
well ill let you know if theres something in the afternoon post
steady on treves have a seat
i feel much better thank you for asking and you
i feel much better thank you
everyone has been very kind i am extremely grateful
of course how long did you and mr treves prepare for this interview
yes of course well its been a pleasure meeting you mr merrick good day
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil
i am very pleased to meet you
three quarters of an hour
what a mess
oh nothing nothing of any great importance
youll know presently at the meeting of the society but until then i beg of you fox keep it to yourself
i dont know what ive got
hes imbecile no doubt from birth he speaks but its all gibberish no the mans a homeless idiot  i pray god hes an idiot
your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england
pardonnezmoi i cannot tell vat is like me
o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies
oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
ive brought you some things i hope youll like mr merrick i hope you dont think it too forward
i knew youd understand here
oh no i would never think it its so beautiful you are so ill give it a place of honor here next to my mother
yes
oh no mr merrick i just work there
youve never been
well you must go it is one of the most beautiful places on earth of course im rather partial
its very difficult to put into a nutshell but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world to any time you desire you may look over the shoulders of kings unobserved battle with ruthless tyrants and marry the beautiful princess all in the space of a few hours onstage you may be whoever you wish to be do anything you please and always always live happily ever after the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world mr merrick it is lights and music gaiety and joy its well its romance

goodbye aud
no wait erik the cloak the cloak invisible it only seems to work on my father
thats right
i must look keitel hold this
of course
i but i
yes  i believe you do
the second note to wake the gods
not quite
there is something i must ask the gods
no no
but aud i i came to find someone
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods so i disguised myself to sabotage their plans
it was my master keitels idea
what dyou mean
we blew the horn resounding
i shouldnt have come
i see the world
it is day of course freya
the sun is up beyond the clouds  where it always is
of course not but when i was a child i remember a dream it was as if the whole sky was blue
the gods are asleep erik
that i cannot tell you
the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores the whole of hybrasil will sink beneath the waves
well for a start er theres no killing
well isnt it great
thats very kind of you but were in rather a hurry were
oh well yes of course its just were looking for the horn resounding and 
oh no no no its just the horn resounding is
im sure its lovely
no no  wed love to hear it wouldnt we
youre just saying that
really
and youre not just saying it because you think we want you to
right summon the musicians well do the one that goes tumtumtum tumtitumtum

not when we explain about the great blessing
i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years and will keep it for the next thousand

what
what dyou expect you come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me
about raping me
you dont like it do you
what about the killing and looting thats just as crude isnt it
why why have you got to go round killing and looting
but thats a circular argument if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out
well you started it
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on
ah
aaagh rape
i didnt mean to
i dunno you looked so so vulnerable
why should you care
what a stupid idea
whats the point of being dead in the land of the living

is that what you want
sorry to track you down like this im not a stalker but i needed to see you
id like to take you out or something
not yet not married
okay
i remember that speech really well
you had the whole human race pegged
i still thought you were going to save me even after that
it would be different if we could just give it another go around
hi
i saw you sitting over here by yourself i thought thank god someone normal who doesnt know how interact at these things either
i cant tell you how happy i am to hear that i mean i dont mean im happy youre uncomfortable but yknow im such a loser every time i come to a party i tell myself im going to be different and its always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod
yeah i know im fishing
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
im joel
yeah like that
i know
enjoy it say goodbye
i know what you mean thats why i stopped
i dont think ive slept in a year
yeah
okay
i love her
i think shes great
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
seems too coincidental that way
yeah yeah it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines
um no
oh
female
what are you doing
i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasnt the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
yeah whats your girlfriends name
i think we should go
i did i walked out the door i felt like i was a scared little kid i thought you knew that about me i ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation you said so go with such disdain
i walked out the door theres no more memory
i love you
yeah
tomorrow
yeah
i dont know
what if
joel come here please
make love
oh um
thats okay i 
hey joel 
im nervous too
well you obviously dont know me
says you were a bully
thats what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
i dont know
says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
i sort of do but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality cleaned up enough to be erotic
i cant stop thinking about you
what old mill is that somewhere we 
i just walked in
oddly enough i do
i guess so
did you send this is it a joke
i mean i havent even told anyone ive met you who would even know to do this
thats what you have to say how could it be true i never even heard of any procedure like this its a joke
i know i spoke to my friend magda
joel weve fucked weve made love like a million times and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night isnt that lovely
hey lover whatcha doing
god i cant believe i ever hated you
guess what im wearing
your dried cum
hi
good i called you at work today they said you were home sick
yeah i tried you at home did you get my message
long day thinking
there you are  naomi its just im afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had
there are two of them couldnt make them out the orange glow of a cigarette
im like a joke to them
maybe im making a mistake maybe i just need to learn to live with this first of all ill get over it secondly it happened those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it who said that churchill im not sure but i dont care she did it to me i have to rid myself of this fuck her
the pill was pink i remember it had some letters and numbers on it what were they al 1718 al something four digits i dont like taking pills when i dont know what they are i have no choice
its too late
clementine i should just maybe talk to her
maybe if i just explain what happened i wouldnt have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and
thats your look for me
oh god i miss her i cant believe shes with that guy now im never going to see her again i love her so much what a fucking monster she is
i wasnt going to call her not after the way she was
and what are you like a wino
is that like us are we just bored with each other
i loved you on this day i love this memory the rain us just hanging
i didnt want to do this but i had to or they wouldve called me a girl
on the couch dark quiet i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times i thought i could take it back erase it explain i had momentarily lost my mind then i told myself we werent happy that was the truth that what we were was safe it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasnt much fun but i wanted fun i saw other people having fun and i wanted it then i thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun im being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit then i thought maybe not maybe not and then i thought as i always do at this point in my argument about dying
this is it the night we met my god its over
i remember being drawn to you even then i thought i love this woman because shes alone down there looking out at the black ocean
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf
i couldnt believe you did that i was paralyzed with fear
i didnt want to go i was too nervous i thought maybe you were a nut but you were exciting you called from upstairs
is there any sort of risk of brain damage
well i did
it was a mess i dont know how it got this way
you have to stop this
im trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased stop it now
you take it i dont know
dont do this to me now joel really
i dont know ive just been thinking maybe were not happy with each other
yknow weve been i dont know sort of unhappy with each other and 
i think maybe were both so used to operating at this level that  how can one person be unhappy if one person is unhappy both have to be by definition
no i just need some space maybe
its not somebody else

just wanted to let you know
she likes you okay
you can if you want
this ones history moving on
patrick we need to focus
she was unconscious patrick
jesus patrick
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties
its a quote book
patrick were in the middle of 
thanks stan i owe you
i know who you are
save your breath for the climb
neither do i ha ha ho ho hee hee
clockworks
siwash huh
the clock people
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
yes everything is getting worse but everything is also getting better
she had a one wayticket to kansas city
easy come easy go
the world isnt going to end you dummy i hope you know that much  but it is going to change its going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue but there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit  and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption it isnt merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative politicaleconomic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but therell be some of us itll miss little pockets of humanity like the clock people like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave theres almost no worldwide calamity  famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield  that you couldnt survive in that cave
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when im living on an isolated ridgetop with delores
im staying with the countess
i dont
well no i dont reside anywhere in particular i just keep moving
you might say that although i dont think of it as traveling
oh rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home
er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am thanks for the breakfast
well that doesnt matter that part never interested me anyway the beatnicks were before my time and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichs and the clap but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl
about
cowgirls exist as an image a fairly common image the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail otherwise theyre being fooled in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls two and both of em are trickriders trickriding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks thats what prostitutes call it you know tricking
no maam no way theres girls on the rubber rose who are political but i dont share their views i got no cowgirl ideology to expound politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
really the chink huh ive gathered that you sometimes speak with him what else have you learned from the chink
what is debbies position
you dont agree with debbie then
from men the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect men have drained the cranes marshes stolen its eggs invaded its privacy polluted its food fouled its air blown it apart with buckshot
so be it it looks serious this time though all these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes
how did this business get started anyhow why are the birds nesting here
drugged is a stupid word
if i flinch when you say you love me its both our problems my confusion becomes your confusion students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts
shes obviously that jesus which would you rather have a million dollars or one of sissys thumbs full of pennies
its high time you realized honey babe that a woman doesnt have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language
ninety degrees to the left i hope how does she feel about you
she always leaves town you dummy that doesnt mean anything what about in bed how does she like it in bed
like what
well er
oh we didnt get it all the way on
i suppose it was mine yes it definitely was my fault
if we ivy leaguers arent earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we dont go around indulging in racist terms such as chink next thing i know youll be calling me chief
what guy
here ill turn down the air conditioner
getting dressed ive got to go
i have to go julian
my thumbs hurt ive made a mistake ive been negligent i havent exercised i have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what its like a musician practicing his scales when i dont practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore
you bet your raggedy white ass i am
american cheese the king of road food
i was a successful model once
i was the yoni yum femininehygiene dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off
yep
im the best
when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twentyseven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
as i developed however i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style time in terms of mph no longer interested me i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast when i am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then i embody the rhythms of the universe i am in a state of grace
tired
a born freak can only go uphill
ive always been proud of the way nature singled me out its the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for ive been steady moving for eleven years and some months maybe i should rest up for a spell im not as young as i used to be
does that mean you might have an assignment for me
bonanza jellybean
your ranch
a job for me
shit o dear thats enough to make me asthmatic the nerve of those twits what do they know about female odor dont interrupt heres my concept my ranch out west its a beauty ranch oh its got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes but its a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women  divorcees and widows mainly  can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment my ranch is named the rubber rose after the rubber rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world so get this its on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence well these cranes stop off at my little pond  siwash lake its called  twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do ive never seen them understand but i hear theyre magnificent very big specimens  i mean huge mothers  and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads now whooping cranes in case you didnt know it are noted for their mating dance its just the wildest show in nature its probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance  leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground dears its overwhelming and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv right there on the home screen creations most elaborate sex ritual  yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground in a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dancewalks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum and a can of dew offcamera a string quartet is playing debussy a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love are you starting to get it doesnt it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud my very goodness gracious grandiose lyrical erotic and girl scout oriented you cant top it ive hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios the best wildlife cinematographers around youre my eternal favorite princess grace herself couldnt be better not even if she had your personality which she doesnt anyway dear im out of photography now and into water colors ah how circuitous conversation is were back at the beginning the exact man ive wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist
purely personal i believe you might enjoy one another
now now dont get exasperated i realize that youve always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and i might add youve been wise heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage for men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics the male gets his food bed laundry tv pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he doesnt have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about but for a woman marriage is surrender
why yes technically jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think
what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship
well okay ill try it i dont see the point in it but ill try it just for you its kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city however
i dont know anything about it
i am your best friend i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
i heard it
so if the ship didnt blow up what happened
id rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it now step aside old man
uh yeah coop im still here
im in the second containment area its pitch black in here there must have been a coolant leak man this shit is everywhere i cant see a damn thing
justin
dont start with me cooper
you can call him babybear he loves that
everybody shut up let the man speak
youre convinced the crew could still be alive after seven years
youve had plenty eva coop its justins turn stay on station if anything happens
coop where are you
hold on coop
ill get him
on my way
you prep the gravity couches im going to manually arm those explosives
it worked for weir prep the tanks
id rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can this ship is bad it watches you
you heard me this ship its crazy trying to go fastern light thats like the tower of babel
you know what happened to the tower of babel dont you it fell down
what about the accumulator
were still venting trace gasses gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole
smith clear that airlock man im coming in
what
no thank you
skipper do we get hazard pay for this
no he didnt
saw what mr cooper what did you really see because what youre describing is not physically possible
im telling you i saw it
i know what i saw and it wasnt a fucking optical effect
it is not
i dont know the screens are dead
youre okay now its over
there must be a way what about engineering
i dont know the process dr weir was the expert
hurry
run
trauma
no time we need whatevers left in our suits to repair the clark like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
his vitals are stable but hes unresponsive to stimuli he might wake up in fifteen minutes he might not wake up at all
goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared
i dont need sleep dj i need answers
well make it
another man who
no
ive been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
its not a distress call its a warning
hear what
save yourself from hell  what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
what happened
oh god dj what do i how do i
oh god
nothing its nothing
a power drain 
you didnt hear it you must have heard it
pressure
hes crashing
his peritoneum has ruptured
i apologize for the short notice bill but weve had something come up that requires your immediate attention lyle
i wouldnt bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and id codes
a written briefing cant possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this i have to go with them
thank you
navigation control tried to hail the vessel this was the only response
you dont just dismiss bill weir the man held oppenheimers chair at princeton if the event horizon had worked he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein
that doesnt mean a damn thing they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill but hes not responsible for what happened to the ship
whats on your mind
its been two years since she died hes over it
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt shes docked in bay four
it wont stop it goes on and on and on
the dark inside me
the dark inside i dont understand
starck
how do you know all this
we still have pressure the radiation counts steady at 7 millirads an hour
thats the second containment seal beyond that engineering
start the countdown
yes sir
almost done i just gotta check one thing
justin
youre not going to die not today i want you to do exactly as i say and im gonna get you out of there alright
justin i wont let you die
dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
i designed the ships propulsion system i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive you cant send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed that would be like like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle
this is not about my reputation this is not about me at all  the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds seven years ago we didnt just lose the ship and the crew we lost the dream  i have to go
the crew could they still be alive
someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers  good for four months
no no its alright i talked to my ex hell keep denny over christmas and ill get him this summer  goddam it skipper i havent seen him in two months
clear and open on my mark three two one mark
ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan
i dont know this place is really dark i cant see a thing
starck you still showing those readings
theres no one here skipper
what you got peters
the science workstation has power ill see if i can find the crew from here
alive
hows the client
skipper
you okay
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
do it
justin
ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there
the clock is running dr weir if youll follow the rest of the crew theyll show you to the gravity tanks
doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no ones even told us why
until then do what youre told and stay out of my way
where has it been for the last seven years
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
captain i didnt come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
that is not acceptable 
peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hotdogging not on this one alright
in an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship that way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
negative
theyre empty dr weir moving forward
dr weirs right get on board the event horizon ill meet you at the airlock
one of my men is down i want to know what happened to him
its possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting spacetime they could be what hit the lewis and clark
its complicated
insane the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star the event horizon could be there in a day
if it worked yes
theres no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields its under control
the date
the event horizons computer thinks its 2034
exactly the ships internal clock is off by seven years
intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time its possible  black holes make sense on paper its all math you see but as to what really happened  the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like lazarus returned from the dead
i dont know
the core
check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations 
what do you want me to say
yes
i dont know
i dont know
i dont know  i dont know theres a lot of things going on here that i dont understand truth takes time
you cant your orders are specific
youre insane youve lost your mind
dont dont do this
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed  fuck this ship
watch me
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or youll find yourself looking for a ride home
son of a bitch
i dont need them anymore where were going we wont need eyes to see
do you know what a singularity is miller does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is  it is nothing absolute and eternal nothing and if god is everything then i have seen the devil  its a liberating experience
what makes you think ill miss
then who the fuck are you
you know
im not the devil
better if i just show you
youre lying
starck cooper
nooo
locked and cocked
what is that
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
bring us in tight starck get on the horn see if anyones listening
thats not it that ship was built to go faster than light thats just wrong it goes against everything we know
something like that yeah
yes sir
i noticed starck anybody home
where is it
starck
love to
starck give me a read
smith where the hell have you been
we dont have time to fart
no ones dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
you heard me smith peters are you with me
im here smith hows the clark
we dont have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air
thats enough
get outside go back to work ill join you shortly
captain we got a problem
she was right behind me i turn around shes gone she could be anywhere
what is it smith
come again skipper
no no we just got her back together
smith smith fuck
justin
lets go
i just finished drying
come around to threethreefour
radiation interference
keep your eyes open
were all here
but you can breathe it
how much ohtwo do we have
carbon dioxide
we can take the filters from the clark
what about the life readings you picked up
whats causing the readings
so where is the rest of the crew weve been over every inch of this ship and all weve found is blood dr weir any suggestions
not acceptable i want to know whats causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
do it dr weir
no it was someone else
dr weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
what is it starck
bioreadings of indeterminate origin dont you have anything useful to tell me
there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged what if there were a connection between the two the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system
to what what are you saying this ship is alive
were hanging on by our fingernails and youre giving me bullshit stories
starck do you know how crazy that sounds its impossible
i thought you wanted an answer and thats the only one i have
nine hours and twentytwo minutes
whats going on in there starck
hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit
you better hurry hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door
five seconds
whatever was on that bridge wasnt weir
weve got to shut it down weve got to
blow it up
no ill be right back
repeat were armed
hes dead
yes
hes been past mars
wasnt that ship destroyed
dj  its okay youre okay just breathe
theyre explosive charges
youre at the bridge ms peters you still havent seen any crew
blood looks like arterial spray
theres no one here
i did
isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
not according to the computer
can you shut it down
keep him talking
come on babybear open this door
skipper justin just activated the door its on a thirty second delay
its cold
say this paper represents spacetime and you want to get from point a here  to point b here  now whats the shortest distance between two points
dead ahead 5000 meters
shes not ugly
shit doc any closer and were gonna need a rubber
thats the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship
were losing atmosphere
it still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
smiths right neptune theres nothing out there if something happens well be on our own
all boards are green everythings five by five
the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel
matching speed now range to target ten thousand meters and closing skipper i got a bad feeling about this
range 3000 meters and closing
1000 meters
picking up magnetic interference
explosive decompression
get them back 
i dont think this is a good idea we dont even know what happened on that ship
how
wrong the shortest distance between two points
do they have pressure
if they were in stasis id get a location but these readings theyre all over the ship it doesnt make any sense
ships log
i dont know the life readings just went off the scale
i cant believe we built this
hmmm claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her i told her that wasnt true i just knew the event horizon better thats all
yes
yes i miss her she died two years now
no theres no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind its as if time just stopped for seven years
it wants me i have to go
im alright please
the forward airlock
it means nothing
you wouldnt say that if you could see me
trust me this aint one of those times
im blind not deaf wanna come in
relax its casual
my stepdads im strictly into stone i was wondering when youd walk by
i like the sound of that
sensual blind chick seeks three ton rockhard heman for deep spiritual relationship
i wouldnt know anything about that
tell me when you grew up in brooklyn how many astronauts did you know  you went your own way then you didnt listen to people so why start now
ill schedule the launch call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
victor did
is it safe
wouldnt want to keep vic waiting
well why didnt you say so you want me to lift some weights or something
the suit will stretch you should try it 
oh he did
its not him its them  i cant live like this
its easy for you to be patient
victor mustve taken him
im worried about you
come on let me buy you something to eat looks like you could use the company
what is this wheres reed
to help you ive run every test known to man and they all yield the same result the machine is ready
he also said wed avoid that storm in space and we know how that turned out
and you can power it up
just get back soon or i start looking for a new groom
i dont care about rocks i care about you  you bring him back in one piece or you can forget being best man
out front you home baby i got a surprise for you
dont come any closer for a sec this is gonna be kind of a shock you remember when we said together forever no matter what
deb its me its still me
i already got it everything i want
this wasnt our first stop in case you forgot nasa and victors not that bad hes just a little  larger than life
youd never know it
ben this is business just work
ben the moneys not important we could save lives
ben think about all the people we can help if this works 
we got what we wanted thats enough
external srbs orbital system engines its just like the shuttles you flew in 
youthful high spirits
im sure hes matured since then
five times
this makes five
hes made a few changes
victors better at these things
should
ben this is serious turn around
three days i was worried about you how are you feeling
reed even you cant compute every little thing
yeah you and debbie and perfect 
im sorry did that cosmicbath loosen your screws
well maybe you should date him
i think i need to lie down bad shrimp
ben are you okay
yeah nine years straight
if were going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes
yeah  you dont wanna know the details
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your 
this isnt permanent johnny we need to be careful until were normal again
oh you remember my name do you you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body
yeah i can tell victor was right
ben i dont know if this thingll change us back or make us worse i need you to be patient for a little while longe
got it teach
forget it egghead im good as is
actually the engines are smes hydrogenbase carbon propellant couple generations past your last ride  im not as dumb as you look
keep talking there wont be a next time
course not strictly business
hey two hearts got busted last time maybe shes not over it either
put your tiny little mind at ease
back on earth victors medical facility were in quarantine
theyre fine everybody else is fine
i swear to you theyve done everything humanly possible the best plastic surgeons in the world ben you had the best 
give me the god damn mirror
go back to the drawing board
really with a name like von doom never saw that one coming
hey im mr sensitivity now  clear the way wide load coming through
and theyre changing into
like the shields reed said would protect us  how long
what do you mean complete
the center for disease control if this thing is contagious 
thats terrible news
i dont know if weve noticed but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window 
so are you
ive never felt better in my life when do you get off work
meet me at 401 top of the run thatll give you a minute to freshen up
stay right left is trouble
last one down springs for room service
not this again 
what about you
ben ben
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
ben are you there
youve been working out
what hes trying to say is every team needs a mascot
oh it is
this place is deluxe you got cable
i can go hotter
gotcha okay supernova bad
what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance 
oh well thats easy im hot youre well youre a little limp sues easy to see through and bens always been a hardass  why arent you writing this down
theyre not costumes
right whatever have fun
act here we go again reed what if we got these gifts for a reason what if we have some you know like calling
but all these people
keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
please tell me you go silent too
johnny
okay mom
i think that thing is ben
grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
you were at 4000 kelvin any hotter youre approaching supernova 
thats the temperature of the sun
girl
dude thats my sister
you gave us names what are you the face of the fantastic four now
blockhead started it
yeah for the last time i hope im done with this freak show im moving back to the real world
at least it beats living in a lab like somebodys science project
look around sis shes not here so you can stop talking to me like im your little boy 
no im sorry for pushing you out
sis let me take care of you for once
and if hes not
showtime
its not just the money i could make money in my sleep
history leonard history everything else is conversation  hows the other matter
recording sir we see you perfectly
stable were looking at low twenties its a good number considering the fallout from 
sir im sure he wouldnt put himself 
actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
later first ive got some unfinished business a deal that needs closing
thats why because i could have any other woman you know when they asked caesar why england he said because its not mine
yes sir youve got the mayor at eight then a ninethirty interview with the journal 
top left like you asked  today wall street tomorrow who knows maybe washington
never better
i was talking about us working together
right thats exactly what i meant
its been changed
well hes welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll you remember my brother johnny
great minds think alike
yes thanks
you always had a way with words  i should be getting back
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
passion
you are such a dork reed you never got it and never will unless its explained to you in quantum physics
what what do you mean you 
lets not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
we need to get past them
what  oh
thats what were here to find out
what about you you havent eaten in days how come youre never on this side of the microscope
excuse me
anger rage frustration
im sure i can come up with something
what in the world would give me that idea
are you kidding
i think it was a little more complicated than 
no there werent there was you and me no variables no math it was actually the simplest thing in the world but your head got in the way like it always does
the plants from space their particles are still charged with the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm
and reverse the mutations 
of course of course
with the right energy we can stabilize the storm maybe tie into the city grid
no way to know without more tests experiments
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
every variable but yourself you dont eat sleep you cant live in your head like 
reed shh just be quiet and look up
you were
i gave him twenty
i did i did reed but i wanted you to be that man
why didnt you say something
reed stop you need to rest your 
you need a doctor
im sure i can come up with something
a gasket reed were at a party
you remember in school we talked about working together thats what i was about to explain
not at all
the numbers seventyfive and its applications and patents
hilarious
sure
get a grip reed we didnt come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch just close the shields
so reel him in but we came here to do a job so lets do it quickly
reed were running out of time
its too late for him and soon itll be too late for all of us
ben did this
hes had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud and hes not the only one
not much we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
i ruined with all due respect i told you to abort 
victor if we could understand what happened to us 
what i should have done a long time ago applications and patents reed this all belongs to me
which is precisely the point analysis is over its time for action my men could have massproduced this by now
i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm
i understand the business reasons
right of course the company but you see ive come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with 
sue ive lived my life unafraid of taking big steps and this is the biggest step yet if it helps think of this as a promotion a merger of sorts  four little words that can change our lives
raising the shields
victor are you feeling alright
just find him
i told you im fine its you im worried about
please no apologies ive arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos youll have roundthe clock care
it is theres something we need to talk about something i need to ask you
susan what are you doing
same old reed all analysis no action wasnt that the problem with you two
then why is reed dragging his feet maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass  its ironic isnt it youre finally the perfect woman for him because youre his science project
oh i think you already have
i know it cant be easy life hasnt changed that much for reed sue and johnny at least they can go out in public but for you people staring whispering behind your back
im just saying i know what its like to lose something you love to see it slip away and know its never coming back
for your sake i hope youre right im sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
arnold whats happening
you want to work at carls
i can probably get you in there just let me talk to dennis taylor
of course
dont worry about it
brad i dont want to have to use sex as a tool
i dont want to talk about it here brad
if youd apologize i think dennis would take you back
look brad ive been trying to think of a way to tell you this were almost out of high school this is our last year i think we owe it to ourselves to be free and meet some new people then if we get back together well know its the right thing
come on spicoli why dont you just put your shirts back on see the sign
totally
its the first door on your left
first door on your left
later
this is how i dress all the time
i thought id take it off for the drive over to ibm its kind of uncomfortable
you really want me to put all this stuff back on
no i want my money back right now
see that sign it says 100 money back guarantee do you know the meaning of the word guarantee do they teach you that here give me my money back
look just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my 275 back okay  please brad
i am so tired i am so tired of dealing with morons how hard is it to
manager
sis
us history mr hand

pay no attention to this swine he cant handle the medicine 
and eat them that bastard wont get away with this whats going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism
god didnt do that you did it youre a fucking narcotics agent that was our cocaine you pig
you whore
maybe thirty more minutes as your attorney i advise you to drive at top speed itll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal are you ready for that checking into a vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid
lacerda
if you think were in trouble now wait until you see whats happening in the elevators
but what about our room and the golf shoes
no no dont leave me
not yet i want to study its habits
you bastard theyll never let us back in that place i leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around  yelling about reptiles you scared the shit out of those people they were ready to call the cops hell the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there
i think hes lying to us i could see it in his eyes
how about nickel nicks slot arcade hot slots that sounds heavy twenty nine cent hotdogs
to do the job of course here we go a crab louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars
why what
what do you expect im your attorney you owe me five bucks i want it now
did the mescaline just kick in or was that debbie reynolds in a silver afro wig
wheres the ether this mescaline isnt working
dogs fucked the pope no fault of mine watch out why money my name is brinks i was born born
nonsense we came here to find the american dream and now were right in the vortex you want to quit you must realize that weve found the main nerve
look over there two women fucking a polar bear
not much why
go
calm down youll be straight in a few hours
ok ill lend you some money lets go outside and see how much we have left
that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door
ok lets pay this bill and get up very slowly its going to be a long walk 
it wont stop its not ever going to stop
probably the bartender he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress
dont go near that elevator thats just what they want us to do trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement
you drive i think theres something wrong with me
what for
no we should leave the poor bastard alone i get the feeling that hes avoiding us for some reason
he told me he was turning in early
that little blonde groupie with the film crew you think he sodomized her
room service sent it up i wanted something to cut the limes
they didnt have any they dont grow in the desert
look you better put that blade away and get your head straight i have to put the car in the lot
music turn it up put that tape on
jefferson airplane white rabbit i want a rising sound
i dig my own graves green water and the white rabbit put it on
how about a check
dont touch it get back in that tub
bullshit dont make me use this
do it i want to get higher
are you ready
why worry youll like it nothing in the world like a mace high forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves
why not hell just a minute ago you were asking me to kill you and now you want to kill me what i should do goddamnit is call the police
theres no choice i wouldnt dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife
what are you doing in baker didnt you get my telegram
youre supposed to be in vegas we have a suite at the flamingo i was just about to leave for the airport
it cant be helped this is lucy  you know  like lucy in the sky with diamonds
plans
shit i met her on the plane and i had all that acid  you know those little blue barrels i gave her a cap before i realized shes a religious freak jesus shes never even had a drink
shes perfect for this gig these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her we can set her up in one of these back street motels hang pictures of jesus all over the room then turn these pigs loose on her hell shes strong shell hold her own
its straight economics this girl is a godsend shit she can make us a grand a day
i figure she can do about four at a time christ if we keep her full of acid thats more like two grand a day maybe three
in a few hours shell probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesusbased rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing uncircumcised member
youll go straight to the gas chamber and even if you manage to beat that theyll send you back to nevada for rape and consentual sodomy shes got to go
we have to cut her loose shes got two hundred dollars and we can always call the cops up there in montana where she lives and turn her in
it just occurred to me that she has no witnesses anything that she says about us is completely worthless
i felt like a nazi but it had to be done
thats good you cant be subtle in this town
maybe we should take it easy tonight
theyre actually nice people when you get to know them
dont mention that word around here youll get them excited
right sure as hell some dopedealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that youre partying with a thousand cops
man you dont know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice
just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a mcdonalds hamburger stand she was a waitress about sixteen years old with a lot of people watching too
they just ran back out into death valley  you know where manson turned up
and every one of them stacked naked
they were all veterans
hurry up with those drinks were thirsty only two rums make mine a bloody mary
we keep it quiet its not the kind of thing youd want to talk about upstairs not with the press around
theyll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs
lucy is looking for you
me
its gone too far
you wont need much just a little tiny taste that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like gingerbeer adrenochrome
hi lucy  yeah its me i got your message what hell no i taught the bastard a lesson hell never forget what  no not dead but he wont be bothering anybody for a while yeah i left him out there i stomped him then pulled all his teeth out
whered you get this
jesus what kind of monster client have you picked up this time theres only one source for this stuff  the adrenaline gland from a living human body
i could already feel the stuff working on me  the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine  maybe i should take a swim i thought
some of what
sure thats a good idea one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia
right
yes
finish the fucking story what happened what about the glands
i think we should put her on the payroll see what she comes up with
inspector rock will pay you in cash a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month
yeh this foreign made crap  is sucking our dollar balance dry
two glasses of ice water with ice
how much is the lemon meringue pie
we had abused every rule that vegas lived by  burning the locals abusing the tourists terrifying the help the only chance now i felt was the possibility that wed gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it
never missed a plane yet
ridiculous just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up you never saw me before shit this town is full of white cadillac convertibles i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate you ready
yeah explaining my position some asshole wrote a poem about that once
youre under arrest
nobody im the maid
i know youre cops but i thought you were just here for that convention i swear all i wanted to do was clean up the room i dont know anything about dope

youre damn right but the first time you say anything about this to anybody  youll go straight to prison for the rest of your life whats your name
i fear nothing
of course officer

aw shucks maam twerent nothin
it aint for lack of trying
why doctor weve only just met
among persons such as yourself creative people under great stress erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of its just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which 
please sit down
i see
and whats that
all right will you please sit down now  symington says
just a little joke miss farmer
stay calm please
ill have someone show you to your room
you didnt say symington says
yes it was very good to see her
youre telling me you feel guilty
do you really believe your mothers trying to kill you
she told me you said mama you want to kill me
and you accused her of tampering with your mail
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative whom do you think i should believe
frances youre still filled with anxiety you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends consequently i didnt recommend your release at the staff review
mental illness is an elusive thing and though im pleased youre feeling more capable its perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time dont you agree
dr symington how big is your dick
cause if its long enough which i doubt why dont you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass
frances im warning you
sedate her
no
no
no no
yeah
youre kidding
what
yes
what is that to you evil as you are
you drove him to his torment
then why weep for him
what kindness
the music or the fire
better that way for me
im very very ugly people are afraid except you
worse
yes i have been seeking my friends
yes very close
people can be kinder than you think
you speak
how did you find me
kill me and have done with it
then why am i here what did you want with me
fine words from a child killer you who murdered my brother
how dare you youre disgusting and evil
i see it before me
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand
materials nothing more
trace memories in the brain perhaps
i dont know
there is something i want  a friend
a companion a female like me so she wont hate me
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all  i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe if i cannot satisfy the one i will demonically indulge the other that choice is yours  youre the one who set this in motion frankenstein
wed travel north my bride and i to the furthest reaches of the pole where no man has ever set foot there we would live out our lives together  no human eye would ever see us again this i vow
yes i want this over and done with
her body pleases me
a brain extremities
what does it matter shell live again youll make her
i will not kill me now
shes not for you
shell never be yours she said my name she remembers
there there shhh
quite right
scandalous what would your dear mother say
and you look so lovely
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a pompous  fellow
its been months its not like him
so have i
elizabeth if its true travel into germany would be banned youd never get near ingolstadt  besides theyre only rumors
read him one of the old letters and rephrase it well say it came today itll set his mind at ease
fine
he set things right with a proper apology and now theyve put him in charge of dissection lab
let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night i left  hes coming home to marry me
is he not back yet
its far too late for him to still be out
arent you
nothing can not ever
its not ours to decide all that live must die its gods will
she was mother to me as well but ours is the job of the living its up to us now to hold this family together we must think of father and be strong for him  i cannot do that alone
he left a beautiful gift in her place a baby boy to cherish and love as our very own your brother
the world is a dizzying place
he needs to vent his outrage to the skies make yourself heard willie learning to walk is not an easy thing why should it be so
give me that child before you fill his head with drivel
quite a sendoff isnt it
and you
ill have to do better than that
to be the best there ever was to push our knowledge beyond our dreams to eradicate disease and pestilence to purge mankind of ignorance and fear
all my life ive known
is that what makes it so delicious
i wish to be your husband
then come with me to ingolstadt marry me now
only you
not as weak as i
your decision for us
until our wedding night when our bodies will join
elizabeth my more than sister
but why risk yourself hasnt this family suffered enough
if what you say is true it is a matter for the police
i know only that he is a killer and i shall bring back his carcass
im all right im safe
its not something i can explain now perhaps someday
so do i
a month at most thats all i ask  elizabeth please things have not yet resolved i must take steps to see that they do for our familys sake for our sake  you are life itself we shall seal our vow the moment i am done
why the change what about your work
it is
does this have something to do with that man you saw
victor tell me why trust me
now husband and wife
i have been waiting for this ever since
open this door for noone
it wouldnt dare
they knew the risks when they signed on ive come too far to turn back now
this ice will break yet  hows our guest
aye captain
youre saying all disease will eventually be eradicated
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes
thank goodness wed be out of work
oh god
very well then
as a march hare
of course i am it pays to humor the insane
victor victor frankenstein
come now magnus agrippa next thing you know youll be teaching toadstools to speak
can you think of a better reason
do me a favor then  keep them to yourself
youre a comfort to me henry
its a letter to my father
these are exciting times henry were entering an era of amazing breakthroughs look at edward jenner he wasnt content to bleed people with leeches he pioneered a new frontier of thought
but you havent listened never in history has so much seemed possible were on the verge of answers undreamt of but only if we have the courage to ask the questions
somebody has to
nothing in moderation clerval
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance
good ill be there to hear his worthless neck snap
it was wrong henry it shouldnt have happened the bastard deserves to die
why waldman he of all people should have cheated death
i resent gods monopoly
blasphemy be damned waldman spent his life trying to help people
no he had more important work
ive been preoccupied
that is my concern  im involved in something just now i want to finish it in waldmans memory
few months perhaps im gathering the raw materials even now
things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak thousand new cases a day now classes have been suspended universitys shut down
listen to what im saying the militias arriving to quarantine the city most of us are getting out while we still can
a week
is that your diagnosis
youve been going roundtheclock
everything in moderation clerval
no they dont
thank you henry
this my home my family  if not for you id be dead in a burial pit somewhere
i didnt find what i was looking for
yes dont worry ill look after your father you look after her
only if youll tell me who he is
let it go
and is it true miss moritz that you love victor frankenstein that your heart was broken  answer the question do you love victor frankenstein
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion
so you have claimed yet you have no explanation for this  the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder the locket you so coveted  how did it come to be in your possession
but surely professor you dont intend we disregard the more philosophical works
those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect paracelsus for one
or albertus magnus cornelius agrippa
victor frankenstein sir  of geneva
despite the lack of challenge
victor explain yourself
you have a way of provoking his  ive been watching you you seem impatient with your studies
you disdain accepted wisdom
i once saw it done as a boy in canton my parents were missionaries the cure was nothing short of miraculous  ive never forgotten it been fascinated ever since
its utterly fantastic this is the sort of thing im talking about we should be learning this
but the possibilities combining ancient knowledge with new something like this could change our fundamental views
i doubt that decision is still mine to make
why
numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system
the strain was evident
oh now you have gone too far theres only one god victor
im dying
are you a physician
theres a startling question coming from you  im captain of this ship we sailed from archangel a month ago seeking a passage to the north pole
wouldbe im plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment
i cant say i blame them were trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of creature
you know of it
then explain it whatever it is it could save the voyage ive spent years planning this my entire fortune
lives are ephemeral the knowledge we gain the achievements we leave behind those live on
madness
who are you
it will be all right ill take care of you
no no theyre all dead
bill  bill  bill is out there
i will protect you
maybe we should wait for mr christy

im like you i dont believe in vampires but i believe in what i saw
in the winnebago
whats an official cross some piece of tin made in taiwan what makes that official if a cross works against vampires its not the cross itself its what the cross represents the cross is a symbol of holiness
yep

kate scott

i didnt say fuck him im just not connected anymore
kate give your old man a little credit every person who chooses the service of god as their lifes work has something in common i dont care if youre a preacher a priest a nun a rabbi or a buddhist monk many many times during your life youll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself am i a fool weve all done it im not going through a lapse what ive experienced is closer to awakening im not trying to shake your faith ive just decided not to devote my life to god anymore
moms got nothing to say shes dead
its a flop house
if it doesnt have a pool were looking for a new place

security  what the hell you talkin about  your base isnt secure
then set out the good plates well all have lunch  my office will follow up with details  jumping off now

dont worry about it  if its off your collar and out of your eyes thats all im going to ask
im not out to change your sex lieutenant  youll have separate beds separate heads  if you have specific medical needs inform the infirmary  if a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner please inform me immediately so i can deal with it immediately  questions
then thats all i have to say dismissed
if you were like everyone else lieutenant i suspect we wouldnt be making statements about not making statements would we  take your leave
didnt take long
its you sir  and it started the day i came here
its this doublestandard the separate quarters the deferential treatment  its how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met
i cant afford civility sir  how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when youve got me set up as an outsider  even if i make it under these rules i still lose because therell always be a flag in my file  yeah she made it but  i mean really  why didnt you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base
pardon
i think youve resented me from the start sir
no sir
the shape doesnt bother me  its just that goddamn rotten stench
same rules for everyone sir
across the board sir
wouldnt dream of it sir
so ill get a fair shot
you makin friends with the press lieutenant
well all have lunch  good idea oh and lets be sure to invite this sociologist too  just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards
permission to evaporate oneil
sir if someone is suggesting that im a lesbian theyre wrong
i find this as distasteful as you lieutenant  but if its on my desk its on my shoulders  theres going to be an inquiry  it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty  you should prepare yourself
i dont see how oneil  dismissed
im not sure what 
sir  what did he say
sir
motherachrist
no problem sir
entering my scan now
smoke her
only blanks  lemme do it

oneil  our airs gonna crap out as soon as we get down there  you know that dont you
ill act surprised
congress and the pentagon share a lot of plumbing  theyll never know whose leak it is
did you hear
not that  the white house just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would in one stroke void all remaining elements of the 1948 combat exclusion laws
whoa whoa whoa  landbased maritime specialties gimme a second here to deeuphemize that
well im just an old dame without much time left so youll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my bloodtype  i am deeply concerned over the navys seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military  case in point
madam senator this is an internal document of the us navy  i must seriously question whether 
i was one member of the investigating commission
im really not prepared for any kind of indepth review of 
that aside for the moment im struck by the tenor the illspirit of your report the degrading remarks by other aviators innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior  in my seven years on this committee ive never seen a downed aviator treated like this  never  im deeply disturbed by this report mr hayes  not just what it bodes for women in the military  but for your own confirmation as well
thank you maam  um may i ask what this is regarding
california
this is just a test case oneil but if it works out  if you work out  it could well change the navys official policy on women in combat  or actually its official nonpolicy  now whos your immediate superior there
my office will fill him in and help expedite  look forward to meeting you at the proper time  jumping off now
yes dear
therell be more to follow  but yes dear right now youre the pick of a very large litter  and your success would mean a lot  jumping now
hmmm  maybe ill ask when i see you in person
gonna be visiting that allwomans americas cup team in a few weeks  if i were a gambler id say dennis oconners days are numbered  but theyre in san diego so i thought id take a quick promenade of the base
lieutenant thomas wickwire
sounds familiar
jordan  might we do this over lunch tomorrow  i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely 
absolutely not
what changed
if i have to ask again senator ill be asking in front of cameras
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire  because he knows what i know  that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harms way
in face i do  roper harris gallop  they all come back the same
im saying its not going to happen not when the president is set to turn this into a thirdrail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him  he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war  and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags
jordan  i dont expect you to fully understand this  but sometimes theres more to be gained from the fight than the victory
the reality is this  we send far too many men off to war  i dont need to compound the problem with women  can you honestly tell me you wanted that life  squatpissing in some thirdworld jungle with 
you promise wickwire a fast ticket too
im sure it is
you know i wonder what the secnav would think about it  if i spoke with him
id go special reconnaissance every bit as tough  and we have a 60 percent dropout rate among the men
doesnt matter who she picks  no woman is going to last one week in a commando training course  and i dont care who it is
i think its more important sir to decide what were going to do  since its apparent this issue is not going away quietly
its really f lee montgomery  but that gets whittled down to just flea  for short maam
no maam
ill work on it maam
snot me  its him
fuck  basherbasher this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction stand by for a prc fix

what all females  if im the only 
i believe he earned it for saving a mans life in saudi arabia  he wanted you to have it  he was very clear on that point
the chief was granted early retirement as of 17hundred yesterday  by 18hundred he was gone  out of the navy
maybe its not my place to speculate on his private thoughts  but i think the chief knew that his way  his world  had come and gone
gotta situation here  where are you  stuck in traffic
signals received only sparingly in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries
youre the analyst for east china oneil  analyze
halfway round the world  so thats the problem  we can get the team in just not out
blank faces here oneil
only four minutes to neutral waters sir  why not
thank you sir  we hear back from the pentagon

is this my glory sir
just like you would be
i take it you dont either  feet
royce  were the same age we started the same time  and now youre sitting in the upperdecks while im still down in the bullpen what does that tell you about the navy
you need operational duty to really advance you need combat training to go operational yet combat training is offlimits to people with tits  im topped out at intel forget the glass ceiling  im beating my head on a big brass ceiling
this has nothing to do with you
get your dick back here  it has everything to do with you
sorry  but after our days  so if i try this thing if i ship out to coronado what happens here
wai wait  what happens if it works  four months of training three years of operational duty what then
which is guyspeak for
you know right up until you said that  i thought i did know
thank you royce  it was shaping up like such a tough call  and then you go and make it so goddamn easy really thank you so much
its hard to find time to sleep royce  much less keep up with my phone life
i feel like theres men here theres women here  then theres men  but hey whatd i expect
me  why me
i saw an article
big symbols make big targets jordan  i think someones gunning for you
im only trying to warn you in case 
thats not what i want jordan  i mean it is and it isnt
jordan  you watch your ass
and this class officer wickwire  you think he was just trying to get even  striking back for
almost like someone put him up to it  okay who
the chief  or maybe even turrentine  your co
its done with royce  let it go
im tired of fighting back  i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay
what about him
sounds like an amazing coincidence
i dont know i dont care
what
you dont crap out of specrecon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country  hes got a sea daddy somewhere
yeah  me too
look  its not like youd be completely out of reach  and maybe we could call in a few favors get you stationed at norfolk instead of coronado  there are ways of dealing with these things  i mean if people are so inclined
yes jordan  ill wait for you no matter how long
well now i feel so much better

it seems the men couldnt get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs  israeli men would linger over wounded females  often to the detriment of the mission often endangering their own lives  they dont use women anymore
for pulling a 210pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia

yes commander
well thats the big question isnt it
its been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years many believe that is a matter collapser a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds
no  i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer but a matter rearranger converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past
my cousins boyfriends sister went out with the screenwriter his favorite movie is the omegaman  hes seen it 13 times
yes commander all right youre almost there just go through the chompers and over the pit

that possibly the valence bonds have shifted bilaterally
what does that mean  yes i see yes it means that perhaps the bonding molecules have become covalent

weve got to get out of here  cmon hurry
jason what about me what do i do
pedal to the metal
commander call me laredo
im trying commander everythings a blur but as long as i stay locked to that vox signal
patience lt  patience
the core could be hardwired to overload without much effort
but sir my men the core implosion is not reversible
get oack on their tail
because theyre coming right at us
they always say that
hmmm shes beneath me im afraid
what does she see in them
congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods  probably their whores
patience colonel arnold  active personalities terrify these men  but congratulations on your victory at ticonderoga
youd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness
you seem pleased by the prospect
well you fought with them against the french and iroquois how good were they then
and a french alliance
it comes down to leaders  if our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe if they go into the forests with the troops eat what they eat fight with them perhaps to die  the most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation
ive come to report that weve had a bit of luck
congress has picked up its skirts and is racing for baltimore theyre not waiting for spring  of course they still had time to deny my promotion  even john adams voted against it
oh they have reasons theres a lot of confusion these days
but trust you to do what  one side in congress wants compromise another glorious battle some surrender  some of course just want power and money  but if you dont mind my asking george what are your plans
the mans waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief
congress is talking  openly  about replacing you with lee
it is
dont do anything rash please benedict
the army can survive without me
someday george you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what congress thinks that is  it may come down to us or them someday  you or them  cicero was right  was is a time when the laws are silent
christ george joseph reeds been writing letters back to congress attacking you  your own aide
were so damned important  look at us  nathanael you were a horse shoer benedict before this
i  you all know my history
while theyre strung out
same old story
that cant be
gates  he used my battle plan and i humbly submit that without me hed still be back at saratoga waiting for the british to attack  george why havent you moved into the potts house back at the creek much more befitting of a commander and chief than your field tent and you could entertain  i think you need to entertain more seriously  get a few new jersey whores up here invite some congressmen couldnt hurt
there then you can have sort of a normal life
im sure his dogs will be overjoyed
couldnt you have appealed to congress
you go too far benedict
cut those men down  congress is pushing ahead with your courtmartial  benedict trust me to handle this
tell mrs washington i am compelled to stay a while longer
you are never never to touch my guns  do you understand
none of the servants is to touch a gun  you know that
a lot of years have gone by
that you would have known you can trust me
yes william  i am apologizing
yes general
yes general
no  i guess
i aint forgot about the freedom
well general i think i aint got no school learning i aint got no trade and im a drunk  so i think there aint much left to be set free
no my lord
yes my lord
many of them many did not possess proper arms  my lord
because they have hardly any uniforms they designate officers with colored ribbons  my lord
i dont know what color is what officer my lord
more than that sir my orders from congress
lafayette will not be happy
the british  these men cannot stand against them
thats greene  hes supporting our reconsolidation
hamilton youre going to have to cover our asses as we cross
then use rocks
ill be twenty next year sir
delighted sir
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i  but if victory is remote and theres any hope for a negotiated peace we must keep this army intact
well sir then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear
and is that the most horrible thing in the world
with pleasure and an honor  did you hear about nathan hale
but its what he said just before they killed him  i regret that i have but one life to give to my country
its a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for
to learn to shoot cannon
we better congress invented him
they go back home to keep their families alive stay into the spring to plant  then they start coming back to us
get the body of our army up to greenes vanguard as fast as we can  all the damned fool has to do is hit the british rearguard and then hold for us
colonel hamilton  anyone who served under arnold i want them shipped north  i dont want any troops here who served under arnold
did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair  most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked  you realize what would happen if this fort fell  the whole hudson would be open to them
dont lie to me hamilton  if i had not courtmartialed arnold
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect
congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions
no one knows
to hell with arnold
is this a coup  alexander are you trying to tell me that i might be assassinated if i dont agree
march on philadelphia  get joseph reed and the pigs in congress the speculators whove grown fat off the war  get them all  sweep them aside
yes i believe so
im not sure
but its more than just that am i right
youre asking me to be president of a republic not king  not a dictator over subjects
good day mister adams george whats the word from boston
whos in command out there
george weve got to get you out there before we lose our whole army
yes an astonishing power over weak minds
as does your ability horatio  we must talk further when its more convenient
i dont know  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things  and if hes popular with his men
i think many would like to see him commanderinchief
lafayette is a child
of course the army will acquit him thats not the point arnold is a man and will understand  what i need to understand is john sam what is happening here  who are those people in there  the fat ones in silk
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went
hes from virginia  there is no more classist elitist english place on earth than virginia  and what in hell has he done for our cause  washington has been preaching compromise compromise compromise  hancock acts he led the boston tea party  thats why new england loves him
i tell you every damned place i go the man is adored  general washington  champion of trenton savior of the republic  and you should hear the way people are deprecating congress
gag on your own invention then
you invented this this
he has the soul of an aristocrat whod like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people
finally  its people like these who as soon as they get a little power want more and more  more ale here
its the political cost of doing business george
if he isnt then hes stupid
these men have suffered but i believe they will fight
i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york  why wont he come on
detained by what
the british army is right back there across that river  sir  i think it must be something else that detains general lee
we already have black soldiers in our army
whats the difference
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain
what can he do  the british have massive superiority
i understand george
george  so good to be back
joseph the british spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges  in my opinion he saved my army
a ground swellchristian movement george you see
to assert the rights of our founding fathers  this country was colonized by christians  this shall become a christian revolution  surely as a good christian you understand that
i mean im a deist  a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin  surely you knew that
they are also very religious  so we will attack them three days from now on christmas  one force under me and another to the south under colonel cadwalader
how many generals do we have like arnold  hes got guts  hes vain and he fights
they help me understand why we fight
joseph are you afraid to cross that river with me  i accept your resignation  with regret  you have leave to return to philadelphia
the man is a traitor
well i shall deny him to you  he is evil on earth
we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with
what i want to know is sir  where is your daddy
uh none just now but
i they look both the same
mon general i have come here to learn and to give not to take  i am serving without salary
i am  then i understand you too serve without salary  you know since your charming little victories at trenton and princeton the french court is softening  i expect any time now a ship load of supplies
i only meant
muskets and uniforms and bayonets
sir these are our finest firearms from the armory at charleville they are a gift from the people of france
i rode here on my horse
yes i will write him and tell his ministers and the court
when the snow melts mon petite marquis i suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red british soldiers
my baby daughter has died my baby mon petite henriette
general lee sir
i will continue with our french allies concentrating on new york
my god these people mean to go to war  they really mean it
war  no  i did not  when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable  theres no middle ground at all  were the kings children
but to go to war over trade over money  surely theres still time for a compromise
my god what
im very aware of that
dont be ridiculous of course that wont happen
and what prize do you see  what could we possible gain
youre no fool george  you never have been
when you lived with the fairfaxes
thats when sally fairfax was tutoring you
and have you heard anything from our dear friend sally  what with all the rumors getting back to england  i thought she might inquire after us  but then i believe she always looked down on us
i think i heard that
what else  from virginia
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army  theres a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal  they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests
oh indeed  you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes  they beg you to consider the future  what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish
some things must never change
dont condescend to me  we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind
martha  for gods sake
come out and meet my soldiers theyre good people
i want you to see our hospital
were leaving them
yessir
yes yes happy to meet you
it isnt my army yet colonel greene  looks like youve seen some action  did you hurt your leg in a fight
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now  my father is an ironmaster  as was i
yes but ive spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history  and i read the lives of caesar alexander hannibal  sir im volunteering you the wholehearted support of the rhode island army
sir congress hasnt issued their pay for two months many have not eaten properly for at least that long  youre being a little hard on them dont you think
well sir i was an ironmaster before you got me  maybe i will let you down yet
you wrong me general i am an officer and a horseshoer
im with captain hamilton
you have a free tongue captain hamilton
you dont believe i can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism
i will not betray you nathanael
then maybe i do see what youre after  perhaps you get to chose again
youve got to stop them here or our whole line will cavein  its all right boys im here
im honored but reluctant to leave you
theyre for my bodyguard  i have an absolute conviction that arnold is planning to have me assassinated  it will be harder if i am surrounded by a body of men who look like me dont you think
it is we need you george
you know i came back to mount vernon to retire  i dont need to be in government
you know very well who it is that i love
but not more than your comfort
thats a lie
perhaps youve been counting my acres mrs fairfax and discovered exactly how poor i really am
id throw everything away for you
i remember a pair of young philosophers once who laughed at the world
really  which precious homily was it
george im sorry
thats not what i said  now sally youre embarrassing me  watch out for her george she talks refinement but she has a barbarous soul
except for that quite like home england that is
words words words  sally has been tutoring george in the philosophies isnt that right
africa of course
slavers capture them and bring them here
sally our slave system is a british law
or civilized
thats just my interpretation actually its a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners you see  walk in a gently z there are four distinct movements
its stupid of course
perhaps you best ask why you wish it  you asked william to teach you manners philosophy decorum as i said its completely stupid
the place to want to be is america every english child dreams of it i dreamt it
its the freest land on earth
well we must be who we must be
what else should i become  theres no difference between virginia and england  i must be educated if im to take my place in society  my father couldnt afford to send me to england for school  he made a shambles of our fortunes  everyone laughs at me
i think i will disappoint you
lets get you darker
why  juba was an african and you want to look the part  hold still
those people  i doubt theyd think of this  ooo youre wonderful this color
im lost in ecstasy  and dost thou love thou charming maid
thats good who
that land belongs to the strongest
just because they are born
who says so
i see
are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war you know why i dont trust revolutions  because each of us is who we are  we make speeches print pamphlets and we never change  the world is not a philosophical abstraction mister adams its us  and i dont believe you can ever change human nature
that  i hear a mob  unemployed drunkards vagabonds the worlds dregs
god damn you sam adams  you wanted a revolutionary army and now that weve really got one it scares you more than it does the british
though sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season
this this is life indeed  life worth preserving such life as juba never felt till now
juba was a numidian
dont be silly you have whole worlds to fathom
an oldsmobile silhouette
yeah well this ones the cadillac of minivans

why dont you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look maybe youll find it
thats what id do  make sure i got the right guy next time
leo spanked a waitress
whatve you got
movie producer yeah why not
where you been harry
we just did i told you my names chili palmer
you look okay to me harry come over here and sit down tell me what you been up to
i want you to keep looking right here okay
you know dick allen mesas casino
were there harry you signed markers for a hundred and a half youre over sixty days past due and you havent told anybody what the problem is
harry lemme give you some advice
i know what a marker is
why do i have to keep looking at you
you gonna get rough now threaten me i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken
fuckin basketball game
i produce feature motion pictures no tv you mentioned grotesque that happened to be grotesque part ii that karen flores was in she starred in all three of my slime creatures releases you might have seen
karen its a pleasure how you doing
you just did
or the guy thinks he could get em broken you have to understand the loan sharks in business the same as anybody else he isnt in it to hurt people hes in it to make money
thats right as a matter of fact
well since leos name was on the passenger list
i dont know about his wanting to meet celebrities thats something new but yeah he comes to la then after that i dont know what happens
i said i had an idea thats all
the shylocks the good guy
wait a minute youre not the guy are you the dry cleaner
you wouldnt be talking to me if you were
but you work for the casino
so you dont work for the casino
what i did till recently  after i get done here ill think about what im gonna do next
they always paid
not really
maybe a few times i have
once
ive been picked up a couple times loan sharking racketeering but i was never convicted im clean
harry look at me
because theyre not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint the first thing theyd do is break my legs
because i need half a million to buy a script
a blockbuster but quality no mutants or maniacs this ones gonna be my driving miss daisy
mr lovejoy
its not bad when you know what its about
whos the star
martin weir he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone
no his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt whitney
shes a rock star every day same time they come down here and have breakfast he has the egg white omelet she has the banana pancakes he sits facing west so he can see his billboard she faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades
so whats the problem
he drown
so youre thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie
im not gonna pop her harry
but i could talk to the limo guys tell em to leave you alone for a while make the point in a way theyd understand it
harry i probably know em better than you do
lets see how we get along
read it its a grabber
theyll be looking at you they dont know who you are
youre kidding right
i dont know maybe i wasnt clear but i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut
never say anything unless you have to
i said id think about it what does that mean in this town nothing
his shrinks trainer
hey harry
get the fuck outta my chair

he died
personally
what get away jet
yeah well maybe the guy took out flight insurance check with the wife
eg means for example ray i think what you wanna say is ie
ask your man here
twenty seven hundred
you know marty you were good in the cyclone
a few weeks before shooting i went back to bensonhurst just to listen to you guys see im italian but i grew up in tarzana so i wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech
its more like your attitude your tone your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves in your opinions your indifference to conventional views
yeah kinda anyway once i have the authentic sounds of speech the rhythms man the patois i can actually begin to think the way those guys do get inside their heads
no i dont though i have to say im curious
if youd like to tell me yeah
one of mine
with what wiseguy money
what happened the pressure got to you
martin look at me
like this
wait how about this
thats not bad
i believe it
yeah but you havent found him yet  the guy took off for las vegas
goodlooking too  like karen
its not that simple you have to be careful theres another guy that comes along a hardon you owe some money to a mob guy wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation
youre not going to tell me the rest
buddy
yeah i like it im high up i can see everything you know its the cadillac of minivans
compass
thats not bad i think you got it down
i didnt know where else to keep it  where would you
they report it to the irs
im up twelve grand today
who told you that

lemme get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before
yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out
i spent all day crawling out of a grave the costumer kept bitching cause i was ripping my nylons 
thats what we finally decided
yeah when you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished when you give us all that look joan crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence not even in mildred pierce  which by the way was a better book than a movie  did crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look
for any movie
man can you scream
cotton
i married martin that was a full time job
he must mean after slime creature 3
harrys dreaming of a fortymillion dollar production hell never get off the ground with a star hell never sign with or without my help
yeah well martin is known for his flipping he flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out
dont go out of your way
right see how your story ends
i just caught the end
i already read it harry left a copy at the house
i dont like the title or the main guys name
not yet
there a part in it for you
sounds fair
i want to know
yesterday you were a loan shark
and you think the movie business is any different
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant
yeah we understand you read the script and like it a lot
the guys setting you up you pulled out of their freaks deal so hes paying you back
depends who pays
not unlike the way nicki met him except it was a wrap party why
you dont like martin much do you
for starters marty wasnt martin back then
how bout get shorty except that isnt a movie thats real life
thats a different story im still working on that one you know getting the visual fabric just right  although ive added to it
yeah theres a girl in it now
you thought i was faking
oh
whichever lets talk about it tomorrow
hey chili look at me
what happened
continental but it doesnt matter martin wont order from the menu
because a movie star can never order straight from the menu they have to think of something they have to have that isnt on the menu
yeah harry you look like you belong in one of your horror movies
hes doing the same thing you did to him playing letterman on tv
are you going down
youre as bad as harry
guys got a fucking pink toilet for christs sake
oh shit im sorry i thought that was im so sorry
you bet
i was scared then not now how long you want me to be scared
go get your stuff
couldnt find my toothbrush
yeah the guy owes momo a few gs
whats momo gonna want with an old place shows old movies people dont care about no more outside of maybe turnin it into a porno house i dont think hes gonna give much of a fuck and you already got a job
thats what the guy said
dont worry about it i wont say any more than i have to if that
thats the dumbest thing i ever heard where do you sleep
dont say a fuckin word
you said dont say nothing and i didnt
you gonna start that again youre just like him all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin thing
howd he know i was in vegas you tell him
yeah well im in la now
im going into the movie business
im thinking about producing
i dont think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer
whatta you mean whose point of view the audiences point of view
what emotion girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick
pick n save
you heard me pick n save
thats great harry so whats the 
harry zimm you look like a wet kiss
come on in
yeah lovely last night i watched two guys carjack a camaro down on the corner of argyle there  what do you want doris

roger that north island arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two over and out
ill sleep good tonight knowing that
with that coxswain dickhead
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
nah everything was cool its just one of those things
sixty pounds
thats what it says
yeah a ship thats supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago you dont think thats just a little freaky
take it easy dodge its only a piece of metal
morning skipper
looks like it took out the backup genny too
its a beautiful country very clean very civilized and cold
well see whos dreamin mman
shes so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and wed never know it
yeah hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later we call this in now gonna be coastguard fbi who knows who all over the place
i aint no mechanic just so you know
i dont know tuesday
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
lemme see was that before or after the oil fire
after fifty years there aint nothin left but shoe leather
amidships starboard at the beam just under the waterline i dont think its a problem
why not
what
what
maureen
roger
no
out here what so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow
bring it on dude
ever heard of insurance big boy
yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong thats a damn big boat its either sunk or it aint
or uninvited guests
thanks for the warning  ow damn
i tell you one thing were not gonna be towing no ship now
whatre you crazy
im telling you i saw somebody i dont know who it was but i saw somebody
gimme a break
so we kill him
maybe he isnt alone
seen a lota movies
oh yeah
a what
i heard a scream when i got there i found him on the floor he was having some kind of seizure i didnt see anybody else
then what the hell happened to him
right wednesday
hell no you think im crazy
why not
what
yeah yeah
are you kidding me jealous epps gimme a break
smugglers maybe
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage the fittings alone could go for a few million
its a risk im willing to take
the damn things been floating around for god knows how long and it hasnt hit anything yet so we take it easy a little of the old push pull
sounds reasonable
what is it
how long to fix
turbine rotors shot
metals crystallized gotta replace the whole deal
like i always say 
the right way and the wrong way
hard to say
im telling you you dont want to be running that fan like it is
its a full 2500 horses down we couldnt drag that boat down hill on ice with it
i gotta pull the blades and reseat everything in a new rotor  
three four days
what do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened cant do it skipper
man it gives me the creeps we got no business towing a ship that size anyway i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway
she take a radio
what you think theres something funny about it
then it happened before they scuttled her
either way they mustve had a pretty good reason
a salvage claim to a vessels cargos as valid as a claim to the vessel itself its ours
it looks like it
so we get a little more for the boat besides the goldll be safer where it is
the sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending whats ours
how about you epps
yeah yeah
warm water current maybe making the metal expand
bullshit that boat hasnt made steam for fifty years we found her shes ours
and what do you propose that we knock this guy off
well stand a watch four on eight off low man first
yeah reconsider fucking his shit up
fresh aint the first word that comes to mind
could be meant as a warning
so whoever did this might still be around
i might be able to find something on the ship but its gonna take time
right
murphy
what is it
not me
if they knew what they were carrying
how do you mean
i guess the best strategys just to tell them the truth
what do you propose
with all due respect skipper  part of that up theres mine id kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it
i dont know what youre talking about
maybe you can tell me then
the radio oh yeah the radio
you smashed it
dont lie to me
you didnt want us calling anybody too liable to ruin your big payday
conveniently enough for you
you better get down here right now were taking water big time
turbine chamber on number two mustve blown took out part of the hull
if money can buy what he wants
then youre a lucky man
right
theres a charming thought
sorry
right
maybe twenty gallons an hour
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps
i bet you did
too big more like a freighter
hed let you off at the nearest port thats for sure
cargo like this could make a crew think twice
probably didnt have time
thats what i call a payday
hell yeah i like it cold colder the better
maybe six feet lanky i didnt get a good look he was far away but i saw him i saw him as sure as youre standing there
youre a pal
because of the gold
no
lights
i feel fine
better than starving to death
yeah fine i just thought i heard something is all
nothing lets get outa here
i didnt sign up to go home empty handed and i sure aint gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this
its my pen name
salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks at least who knows could be more could be a lot more  what im proposing is we split it four ways
they mustve scuttled it nobody just lets a ship float away
yeah thanks
some charts a crew manifest  looks like her last voyage was january 1953 the question is where the hells she been since
her destination was halifax yeah
nope
so what did happen
you think shes sailing without a crew
youre more practical than superstitious
maybe but theres always somebody whose interests at stake
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
did you see him
the guy he just came this way
theres somebody else on this boat
i saw him just a minute ago some guy
of course im sure i saw him
it wasnt you it was somebody else theres somebody else aboard
we dont exactly have the best bargaining position
dodge get on that turbine i dont care if you dont sleep for a week the sooner youre done the sooner we can get out of here hows the food situation
no cowboy shit right
yup
epps
yeah just a bird just a stupid bird
greer
ill call us in dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up  keep an eye on him
same any luck
possibly false hence the ima record of being lost at sea i dont think mutinys out of the question here
if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
what
but who  
february first
must notve been the captains entry he was probably out of the picture by then
collision with what
but wheres the damage
if it was a ship she hit
let em ask this ships legally ours now
doesnt matter
hey
wish i could say the same
i guess thats the sixty four thousand dollar question isnt it
never mind before your time  i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide what happened after that is anybodys guess but judging by our greek friends down below it doesnt look like the last time
i dont know are we
not our mystery guest again
i dont know what else youd call her one second she was there the next she was gone
showing you what
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks
victims of what
that much i think weve already established
whats that supposed to mean
just lucky i guess
epps over
hes not on deck and i cant raise him on the radio
right here
leave him till we can get some help  from now on nobody comes down here
could be a stroke who knows  the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves like wild dogs
maybe it was more than that
crazy with greed not crazy not like him
if the weather holds it might not be so bad
we hit land
were in an island chain its only a matter of time before we hit another one
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody  you saw it coming as well as i did dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat and greer too except he went nuts couldnt take it i guess couldve happened in the middle of downtown anchorage but did it make him any less dangerous i dont think so
the way i figure it it was them or me i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch bought a little time made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around but its just us on this ship us and your spirit friends
i didnt want it to turn out this way
i think i see it pretty well
i know a little bit about human nature and what ive seen only confirms that
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo theres nothing supernatural about greed and thats what it comes down to pure and simple
i wish i could believe that either way you know what ive done ive got no choice
go
of course they did
what do you say dodge
hell sell the scrap for three times what he paid
you got that right
red sky in morning sailor take warning
theres a large vessel out about ten miles to the northwest
alright ill be right up
looks like its adrift
steer to one eight five lets check her out
hows that
sorry
you mean tow her back thats a thirty thousand ton ship youre talking about
so we cut her loose and wait it out a little weather couldnt be anything she hasnt seen before
yeah
youre up late
hard to say maybe forty fifty million
not for fifty million an ocean liner maybe but fifty million in gold they come looking for
we leave it where it is stick to the plan
its worth the effort believe me besides were gonna need her to prove the salvage
dodge you gotta get on those repairs
we could call for help
not much at all i guess retire live out my golden years and all that
moving to sweden
lets just take it easy here alright nobodys gonna kill anybody
would you hold on just a minute here please look theres no reason to panic now epps saw somebody fine its a big boat  chancesre real good he doesnt even know about the gold if we stay cool nobodyll be the wiser  the gold stays where it is til were ready to go like i said itll be a hell of a lot safer there than here
well have to take it easy then i dont think well find much aboard the ship but its probably worth looking around
couldnt have happened much more than a month ago
and look what happened
maybe
drink up then
lost my sea legs
you dont remember
youve been out for about a day
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins
we heard you scream any idea what you mightve seen
alright everybody grab your gear this is where we get off
the coast guard has our last position theyll send somebody out soon enough a ship this size you cant exactly miss
shut up
a what
the mooring hasnt come taught
mustve heard something below deck and went down to check it out
so whoever did this now has our shotgun
leave it
you think whoever did this is reasonable
fine with me
whynt you mind your own business chief
didnt you hear me grandpa or you got your hearing aid turned down
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me tarzan
better late than never
you got a leak in the number nine compartment
you pump it out and reseam the hull shell be good as new
fifteen at the most
you want fair pay make hamburger for mickey d otherwise please to sign
nope what are you making pancakes
its tough to find a good job without any kind of training
well i think its good to keep all your options open you can always enroll for the winter quarter  you could even live here and go to the city college part time and still get a job if you wanted to
who
how should i know
who
yes
not the maxine
god how horrifying
i made spaghetti do you want some
what is it now
i guess
tell her to forget it  i dont need her help
nothing
ive got some important news to tell you but it can wait till later if youre not feeling
well as you know maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the summer just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want
are you going to yell at me
yeah i heard about that
she understands what youre going through and she really wants to help you she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it
actually i was just checking to see if you were here  your friend seymour is on his way up
i just buzzed him in
but i cant 
oh i love to cook i guess most women wouldnt invite a man over on the first date but i believe you should trust your instincts when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so i dont know harmless ready for ice cream

i uh i feel that i need to uh  theres something i feel i have to say i uh ive never said this to anyone before  believe me ive stayed in horrible relationships for years just so i wouldnt have to do this but i uh
its just that i feel like its maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out
please tell me it isnt that teenager
i cant believe this i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me
enid its sort of like a diary i guess
its supposed to be don knotts
i dunno i just like don knotts
well i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cooks chicken used to be called coons chicken and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture
well no  its more like a found art object
its complicated i guess im trying to show how racism used to  more out in the open and now its hidden or something
im not sure i mean  i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why its so shocking
uhoh
im not really sure  working i guess
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything it is really quite an offer
so what do you think
well yes
let me know as soon as you can enid this could be a great thing for you
what do you mean
huh
i didnt check my messages

i wonder if hes just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or 
josh
yeah hes beyond human stuff like that

or maybe did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos maybe thats why we spend so much time together
which one
hes like the biggest idiot of all time
yeah right believe me at this point im over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me
thats not true i just hate all these obnoxious extroverted pseudo bohemian losers  sometimes i think i act so weird because im crazy from sexual frustration
maybe we should be lesbos
yeah maybe itll be okay at least ill get to see every movie for free i guess i had to lie and tell them i already graduated
i dunno but next week is my last class

i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that hes the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that
no matter what happened it would be a big disaster lets just try and keep everything the way it is
i cant afford stuff like this right now
why do you care about this kind of stuff
i cant imagine spending money on towels
youre insane

i dont know god dont act so jealous i only talked to him for two minutes

god fuck you
indian records
i dont have anything after about 1935 i may have one hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection but its not really for sale i dont really collect foreign
sure wait maybe not 78s but i can play regular records
sure i guess
nah its not so great heres the one id recommend
wow
a dollar seventyfive
so you really liked it yeah theres some really rare performances you liked that memphis minnie huh
the skip james record yeah thats a masterpiece there are no other records like that i actually have the original 78 of it in my collection its one of maybe five known copies
do you want to see it i can run upstairs and get it
watch my stuff
no
i i didnt think you would have any interest in this get together i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you  its not like a real party or anything
oh god no this is just junk i have for sale or trade the record room is offlimits
yeah well sure you can if you want to its just i dont want all these guys in there at once you know
i have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point ive tried to pare down my collection to the essential
please go ahead and kill me this stuff doesnt make you happy believe me
you think its healthy to obsessively collect things you cant connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff  im just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers
yeah right if im so cool why havent i had a girlfriend in four years i cant even remember the last time a girl talked to me
oh right
good luck
yeah well
i appreciate the offer but you really dont 
jesus thats very nice of you enid but i  i really 
i dont know what kind of question is that i mean its totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me
i really didnt get a good look at her
jesus
im just not one of those guys who has a type
i mean as long as shes not a complete imbecile and shes even remotely attractive
maybe i dont want to meet someone who shares my interests  i hate my interests where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself
well lets see i guess id have to put traditional jazz blues and ragtime music at the top of the list then probably
josh hes nobodys boyfriend hes just this guy that becky and i like to torture
oh my god we have to go in here
please seymour becky and i have been dying to go in here but we cant get any boys to take us  please
well just go in for one minute  itll be a riot
please we have to
fine ill go by myself then
shh
these are older women just dressed up to look young i think
cmon seymour please
that thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud  its like someone jabbing me in the face  kfto comin atchya on this beautiful evening
i brought it for him to autograph hes going to be amazed to see it  its one of two known copies i cant believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner what an insult
im not holding my breath in that department
jesus seymour
well offer her a seat you want me to do it
just wait here
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label
now i remember why i havent gone anywhere in months im not even in the same universe as those creatures back there i might as well be from another planet
look i really appreciate your help enid but lets face it this is hopeless
yeah well its simple for everybody else  give em a big mac and a pair of nikes and theyre happy i just cant relate to 999 of humanity
but its not totally hopeless for you ive had it i dont even have the energy to try anymore  you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you dont end up like me
hooray for me
it doesnt matter im not staying long i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet
if you dont mind my asking  why do you care so much if i get a date or not
what oh that i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago i guess its mine now
yeah right im a klansman  thanks a lot do you know the cooks chicken franchise
yeah well cooks is just a made up name when they originally opened back in 1922 they were named the coon chicken inn  thats an early painting of their first logo
you work at cooks chicken
what are you a fry cook or something
jesus id go nuts if i had to work in an office all day
yeah but still
no in a lot of ways things are better now i dunno its complicated everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something
what why
i dunno theyre very sensitive at work about all this stuff maybe it would be better if you 
oh uh thanks a lot enid i really appreciate it
are you okay
oh uh its just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support
maybe now you understand why i cant get a date
thats the spirit
really
im starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really wouldnt change anything
then again thats easy for me to say since ill never even get a date im sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you
oh yeah
why
i wont even dignify that with a response
who knows
let the machine get it i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me
its just somebodys idea of a joke
uh yeah a long time ago she called before once its just somebody trying to humiliate me
how can you be so sure
hi its me
so what happened
what youre kidding me
what are you going to like have sex with her on your first date
yaaa
really
i know im sorry iive been really busy
oh pretty well surprisingly you know
sort of she doesnt dislike any of that stuff shes trying anyway actually were supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon
what are you trying to get rid of me
arent you even going to ask me how im doing
i dunno okay i guess  i fucked that guy josh finally
maybe i dunno he wants to be of course im weighing several offers at the present time
i i dont know i dont really think i should
i better not
i i wish i could enid but i really cant right now i  its just that i 
its just that well you know dana just got out of a really bad relationship and i dont want to give her the wrong idea you know
and you like them
so thats it you dont ever want to see me again
whats her problem anyway  did she actually tell you you couldnt see me
what does she mean by that  somebody like me
you must have done something to make her think you like me
does that mean you dont like me
so do you like me seymour
in whatever way you think i mean
i dont think you understand how i really feel about you seymour
nothing dont worry i wont bother you any more
i had to see you
can you at least let me in
look i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then ill leave you alone
do you have anything to drink
what about this
fuck dana im sick of dana
i could never move  ive got too much stuff
dana bought it when we went antique shopping she said it didnt go with her stuff so she gave it to me she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs
thats great halfempty  thats what i like about you seymour youre a natural pessimist
what are you talking about youre disappointed every minute of your life
at least youre not like every other stupid guy in the world  all they care about are guitars and sports theyre all such fags
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date you never asked me out
yeah but still its kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that
i dunno i always feel like everybody secretly hates me im just paranoid i guess i mean you like me dont you were good friends right
maybe i should just move in here with you i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job
oh yeah and dana  you were a lot more fun before you met dana youve been acting way too normal lately youre a bitter twisted fuckedup guy seymour thats why i like you
what
i guess i probably used to when i was your age
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems
i dont think im in any condition to drive
so where would we go
i dunno i
what do you want
iii
do you really want us to drive away somewhere
i will if you want to
ii never expected anything like this to happen
you must know i always did you really mean all that about moving in with me
but i
i can treat him any way i want to  im an adult leave me alone
theyre seymours
dont worry about it hes not gettin any and neither are you
right
yeah im really really happy really having a good time
maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy who knows it could be a million things its wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain thats for sure
yeah well thanks for cheering me up
forget it theres no way find some other poor sucker to abuse
he has every reason to freak out  this is a totally fuckedup thing to do to somebody
i wish i could see him
yeah
i am
its my response to the issue of a womans right to choose its something i feel superstrongly about
its a tampon in a teacup
its a found object thats when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood because of tea parties in the olden days but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this like
right exactly
shes not at home
what the fuck is she doing she was supposed to be here three hours ago
are you sure she wasnt there  maybe she was just hiding from you
i dont know where is she then
josh why would she be with josh
why what did she tell you
what is she having some secret affair with josh
why wouldnt she tell me theres no way she could never keep that to herself youre crazy
that slut
yeah she thinks youre a dork
look what do you expect  considering how we met you
on that pathetic fake blind date
didnt she ever tell you about that god she really is pathological
so tell me more about this job what exactly will you be doing
remember what i said when we first started  this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you
why dont we start with that next week
dont thank me youre doing all the work
yes
malaria epidemic very sudden
oh youre a doctor now too
on that i choose to remain dubious  two are dead now in two nights 
you do not call me a liar you know nothing of their health consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay
hell replace you too thats all you really care about
as are they all
thats ridiculous talk and you cant seriously believe it
at last youre right we do you are the problem in tsavo
you dont know all that has happened here the devil has come to tsavo
am i to take it you want to live
excellent decision  your name is abdullah im sure well meet again go and enjoy the splendid morning
how we dont know where they are
my wife is the game player in the family sir
im sure youve examined my record so you know ive never yet been late on a bridge
but i have in india every country presents problems
ive got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised id be with her when the baby comes
you wont have the chance  any further words of encouragement  then ive a train to catch
how could it be i hate africa
dont they though
but overall youre pleased
starling
yes he is
whats the surprise in that this is africa
what have they done besides kill starling  how many have they killed 
im calling it my contraption were going to surround it with a boma a fence to you and were going to leave a small opening opposite that door
genius the beast will enter tripping the wire the door will slide down trapping him you safe behind the bars will have him at your mercy and will shoot him
i didnt conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger
in point of fact it didnt  but im convinced the theory is sound
i made a mistake hiring you youre simply not up to the job 
all theyll bring is more chaos and weve plenty of that already and if they come in word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then
every man whos ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him the lions will be dead
not a time for modesty bob
then why do you stay
karim will have to show me where it happened and of course ill need the donkey  with any luck ill sort it out tonight 
you dont enjoy killing do you 
you never had it
well he got away didnt he  riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them donkey took the brunt of it then suddenly the lion ran off
please you neednt be so graphic
is it im sorry but then of course youre the doctor you should know
i suppose i could answer you i suppose i could explain that the place is so inviting what with the smell of blood and flesh that they have to strike its even possible that i tell you i found some fresh paw marks around back which means theyre already contemplating feasting here  but i dont want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that i dont have the least idea what i am doing that i am nothing but an incompetent that i am a fool  anyone who finds me a fool please say so now
then we agree 
were not much good at goodbyes helena
it was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments
well its just  other men dont abandon their wives at such a time
what if there are complications
i am desperate to see africa but i hate the leaving
we have hunted since childhood
that is correct  nothing
i would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving
i assure you we came close many times
he just gave me his monster speech
the females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they wouldnt survive because the males eat the young
just that they fart through their mouths  must make kissing something of a gamble
almost three hours  but ive been getting ready all my life 
beaumont says its to end slavery
have you got that in writing 
does he speak english
ive got medical supplies to deliver come along to the hospital when youre done 
and anxious to get started  what is this mostly malaria
well he put me in a spot didnt he but thats all right after all im responsible for everything that happens here and it certainly wont do much for morale if a maneaters on the prowl
we know three things about maneaters first they always return to where theyve attacked before second theyre always old they cant catch other animals so they turn to us and third theyre always alone theyve been cast out by their pride because they cant keep up
might be exciting for you
id love the company and ive hunted all my life
shhh
youll have to deal with it nigel
what
not to terrify you nigel but its worse than you think ive never even seen one
so thats what a lion looks like 
true enough but without the comedy relief 
arent we full of ourselves today  i think its because of the lion
you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just  there
john it will not be easy
but you said they were always old
far end of camp man wandering alone at night hawthornes examining the body now  theres even less of him than of singh
you mean nobody died
what did i do
nonsense samuel would have done something 
let me save time  you are the engineer  you are in charge  youre sorry im here right so far  good because  i am not an engineer  i dont want to be in charge and  im sorrier than you are that im here i hate tsavo so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave see any problems
all right lets go into battle  im redbeard 
thats very considerate
no but you do  see you were needed after all  and fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
i can try
it was probably luck id rather you did the shooting
has it ever done that before
have you ever failed
its all right stay ready  they know its there
but of course yours worked
you just got hit  the getting up is up to you but theyre only lions  and im going after them crack of dawn 
what happened to them
nobodys seen anything like this lions dont have caves like this  theyre doing it for pleasure
dont they have to be
not for me im too bulky and its your idea you go up there  take the others to the water tower for the night
yes and ill be in some distant tree where i can provide no assistance whatsoever  can you control your fear
i cant control mine id be lost without the shame factor driving me
you think theyll come then  why
why
the most of any lions a hundred  probably more  johnny
understood you realize now you could never have done it without me
because they are here  because tsavo is the worst place in the world  come john to the bridge 
thank you the truth is this you have to work at it constantly
get on they detest each other obviously the africans hate the indians but the indians also hate the other indians some of them worship cows while others eat them 
this is more difficult
clearly you dont agree about building the railroad
you they cannot believe youre still here
you dont know what tsavo means do you  it means slaughter
fine get started and a strict curfew no one allowed out at night  send half your men to the bridge the rest with these two  and im sorry for my tone earlier but i repeat there is no reason for fear i will kill the lion and i will build the bridge
look out samuel here it comes
thank you samuel
i expect so its from my wife
i do actually very much
i have to ask why do you need me
oh yes but it takes time
since his beard was red
he doesnt he needs nobody but we have hunted many times  he knows i am afraid of lions
i feel the same about the bridge this country certainly didnt ask for it doesnt need it
once 
underneath  somewhere
its all right samuel we all get hit 
i dont believe you had a mother 
four should do it
because i have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men
not even close  what happened
and where will you sleep beautifully
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas you
some mysteries should not have solutions
you know you are really doing very good work here  i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations
actually im not eating lunch today  i have an appointment  in fact id better go
im sorry  perhaps some other time
hello dana  i happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought id stop by to see if everythings all right with you  you know with the blackout and everything are you okay  is the baby all right
no everythings fine  honestly  thanks anyway
good night janosz
oh im sorry  this is peter venkman peter janosz poha
no harm will come to the child  you might even say its a privilege  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo  and you  well you will be the mother of the ruler of the world  doesnt that sound nice
i dont believe we have the luxury of choice
not in this case my dear  take a look thats not gainsboroughs blue boy up there hes vigo
we dont have a relationship
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul  i could never forgive what youve done to me and my child
id rather not
im not saying you did  in science we always look for the simplest explanation
im trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field  its a theory ray and i were working on when we had to dissolve ghostbusters
okay whatever you think  but not venkman
do you ever see him
how is he these days
does he ever mention me
certainly
i wont
im not a doorman miss barrett  im a building superintendent
okay okay  its not my job but what the hell  ill do you a favor  he takes the grocery bags from her
thats a goodlooking kid you got there ms barrett
didnt i do it
okay thats no problem
you know dana im very very hurt that you didnt call me first  im still into all this stuff you know  havent you ever seen my show
i can see that youre still very bitter about us but in the interest of science im going to give it my best shot  lets go to work boys
he didnt ditch me  we had some problems he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it
you never asked me and every time i brought it up youd get drowsy and fall asleep
well when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain thats when i left
theres no doubt about it  hes got his fathers looks  the kid is ugly  extremely ugly  and smelly  you stink  its just horrible  you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled  whats his name
oscar  you poor kid
unusual  i dont know  i havent had a lot of experience with babies
ill supervise
we definitely had a moment or two
okay lets take a look
you are personally responsible  if i can get conjugal rights will you visit me at sing sing
dont worry about me  im like a cat
im el gato  i always land on my feet
thanks
oh hello peter
i didnt paint it  im just cleaning it its an original ver meer  its worth about ten million dollars
as a matter of fact i stopped by to tell you that i havent forgotten your problem and that were still on the case
yeah its not the kind of thing youd want to hang in the rec room  you know what it needs  a fluffy little white kitten in the corner
goodbye peter
no i just got in  a couple hours ago come on in  are we having a pajama party
i must be losing my mind  at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me
i dont know what to do anymore
peter what about the bathtub
it was full of this awful pink ooze
peter this is very nice but you dont have to do any of this you know
really  and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby
thank you  poor baby  i think i should put him down now
yes im very clean  did they find anything at my apartment
now you get dressed and we go out  i got a babysitter and everything  trust me you need it
its janine melnitz from my staff  shes one of my most valuable employees
janine melnitz are you kidding  do i have a vase  i brought some of your clothes  wear something intriguing  i brought along some interesting possibilities
i put them in your hamper  i thought they were dirty
i want to stop getting involved with men who arent good for me
for one night in your life do you think its possible for us to be completely real
oh peter i didnt dump you  i just had to protect myself  you really werent very good for me you know
why do you say things like that  youre so much better than you know
so why dont you give me a jingle in the year 2000
dont worry  janine has a very special way with children
finally came to your senses huh
same difference
so what  its a free country  thanks lib
no problem  always glad to help  and hug
a little to the left  right there  thats where it stopped
peter do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
valentines day  thats got to be a bummer where did you get that date elaine
your alien had a room in the holiday inn
no you cant and i think thats the whole problem with aliens you just cant trust them you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or et but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard  anyway were just about out of time  next week on world of the psychic hairless pets  until then this is peter venkman saying    good night
yeah you can get your hand off my chest
im an old friend of the mayors  i just want to say hello to him
no thats what i want to talk to the mayor about  we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you
yeah i think the times might be interested dont you  the post might have a lot of fun with it too
now youre talking
oh you think so  well ive got news for you  youve got draculas brotherinlaw in there and hes got my girlfriend and her kid  around about midnight tonight when youre partying uptown this guys going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants  and thats just round one
its that darn ghost again  i dont know what to do anymore  he just wont leave us alone  i guess well just have to move
ghostbusters
what are you doing up here
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if youre already an accountant
no i celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is march first that way i beat the crowds
janine do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home
oh sure that sounds great
so these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them
so they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services which was a good deal for all of them because then they didnt have to withhold tax and social security which im not saying is right but its just a story so i guess its all right  i can finish this later if youre tired
okay
tonight
i dont think we should leave her alone
oh yeah sure  no  but theres really not much to do here and they might need some backup at the museum
how are you  whats that youre working on johnny
too bad for the moldavians
well id make an exception in this case if i were you
my pleasure
i know
we got a major creep alert and were just going down the list  your name was first
the upper west side
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio people start imagining things 
not  dont leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities well be back
oh johnny  did you back the wrong horse
command me lord
yes the scourge 
 the sorrow 
i await the word of vigo
lord vigo the mother dana is fine and strong  i was wondering  well would it be possible  if i bring the baby could i have the woman
sorry your honor but when somebody sets me up like that i cant resist
who are they
maybe they just want to appeal
youve got to stop them  please
okay let me rephrase that question  didnt you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children
do i
yes
get on with it counselor
did i forget something
i cant do it louis  it isnt ethical  i could lose my license
im a dermatologist  i cant write orders on the psych ward
like what
you were the one who got me in
yeah i had to give her free dermabrasion for a year  forget it louis  i could get in a lot of trouble
then you should go to the police  i dont believe in any of that stuff
hi its really great to meet you guys  i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed but i knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that 
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster
well i think its important for people to know that the world is in danger
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new years eve
this is not just some moneymaking scheme  i didnt just make up the date  i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new years eve
objection  irrelevant and immaterial
seventyseventh and first avenue has so many holes already we didnt think anyone would notice
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in but im going to tell you the truth there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding things that cant be explained and that most people dont want to know about anyway  thats where we come in
no i guess im just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it
hello venkman
i think theyre more interested in my epididymis
yeah you would  is that for personal or professional reasons
i think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street
i knew that
you need the exercise
a hundred and five years  he really hung on didnt he
its a rough translation from the moldavian
roach breeding  sounds better and better  dana  the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime  egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roachbreeding surge  should we forget about dinner and go with them instead
this wont wait until tomorrow venkman its hot and its ready to pop
they love you lib  keep it up
im worried  the vibrations could shake her to pieces  we should have padded her feet
its probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country
they came from ostrov in eastern poland
some crank  looking for goat hooves  come up with anything
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis
why dont we try the gigameter
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole
his nickname is the hammer
it may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source
and were the 
this guy was a bad monkey  he dabbled in all the black arts and listen to this prophecy  just before his head died his last words were death is but a door time is but a window  ill be back
thats it  its on the bottom
butt out you pencilnecked geek  ive had it with you
i cant believe things have gotten so bad in this city that theres no way back sure its crowded its dirty its noisy and there are too many people whod just as soon step on your face as look at you  but thereve got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burnedout burg  we just have to mobilize it
something good 
do it  just do it
you mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes
id put my money on that vigo character
no the slime is rising
and its all flowing toward the museum
theres something very familiar about this painting
oh hiya pete
i knew that voice sounded familiar  whats up  hows it going
uh i cant  im kind of working on something
oh just checking something for an old friend
who  just  someone we know
aaah  nobody  i cant tell you
dana  dana barrett

okay lets heat em up
im peter 
hold on ray  halfprice  have you gone crazy
if he wasnt dead hed be an olympic prospect
its not that thing you do with your nostrils is it
no im just restoring it to its normal state
this is an incredible breakthrough venkman a psychoreactive substance  whatever this is it clearly responds to human emotional states
were running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction
well we sing to it we talk to it we say supportive nurturing things 
nothing  just some moodslime residue in and around the bathtub  but we did turn up some interesting stuff on this vigo character you mentioned  i found the name vigo the carpathian in leon zundingers magicians martyrs and madmen  listen to this
ill get one more reading
you just picked up three penalty points on your drivers license
were going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psychoreactive slime flow  we thought you might want to come along
okay but youre missing all the fun
yeah sorry i missed it  i guess you guys didnt know about the dress code here  its really kind of a coat and tie place
i hate jello
good effort  now what  should we say supportive nurturing things to it ray
only one way to find out  ready teddy

fine  this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your groups activities
dr venkman we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind  you however seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle  your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable  youre a poor scientist dr venkman and you have no place in this department or in this university
hes a big one  you dont want to mess with that particular breed
yeah its some kind of mallowtype substance  thats for sure
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area

what is it
i dont believe in luck
thank you

forget it venkman  you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me  now its my turn smartass
see  they are using drugs
probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the army 
thats peck
a square
close  but definitely wrong
yes  i dont like this
two wavy lines
you volunteered didnt you  arent we paying you for this
im studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability
then my theory was correct
theyre not guns  theyre particle throwers
i couldnt do that  you might hurt someone
on earth  no  but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna
were you recently in the bathroom
the wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating 
when you were in the bathroom did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly
what have you got egon
egon somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head  do you remember that
im always serious
will you guys relax  we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade  professional paranormal investigations and eliminations  the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams
shes telling the truth  or at least she thinks she is
didnt see anything  didnt get anything nice girl  no ghost  im starting to worry  you said your graph was pointing to something big  you told me things were going to start popping
yeah i can smell it
what
why not
what do you mean bad
what is it
does she want to be
some  i just met the keymaster  hes here with me now  venkman  are you there
i agree
ill spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning
if you turn that thing off we wont be responsible for the consequences
oh shit
let me guess  gozer worshippers
she said he was the destructor
gozer
get a grip on yourself egon  i talked to dana barrett and she referred to gozer as the destructor
fullstream with strogon pulse
no  them  shoot them  cross the beams
life is just a state of mind
or even a race memory stored in the collective unconscious  and i wouldnt rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either
i blame myself
wed better adjust our streams
god its ugly
easy  easy  im going to throw in my trap now
neutronize  system shut
i need two new purge valves  hows the grid around the storage facility holding up
the storage facility blew  this one    shut off the protection grid
and look at this peter  coldriveted girders with selenium cores
that appears to be the case
peter at 140 this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue ten people witnessed a freeroaming vaporous fulltorso apparition  it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away  scared the socks off some poor librarian
no this ones for real peter  spengler went down there and took some pke readings right off the top of the scale  buried the needle  were close this time i can feel it
ray as your friend i have to tell you i think youve really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff  youve been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the five boroughs who thinks hes had an experience  and what have you seen
looked at with your eyes
uhhuh  ive heard about the rockfall ray i think youve been spending too much time with spengler
it looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly
what do we do now
what do i say
hey lady  lady  can you talk  who are you   this is not working  think of something else
i guess i got a little overexcited  wasnt it incredible  im telling you this is a first  you know what this could mean to the university
if anyone deserves it its spengler and me were doing all the hard research and designing the equipment
ray i apologize  i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced  they did this to galileo too
youre always so worried about your reputation  we dont need the university einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerkthey cant stop progress
let me tell you ray everything in life happens for a reason  call it fate call it luck karma whatever  i think we were destined to get kicked out of there
to go into business for ourselves
my parents left me that house i was born there
but at nineteen percent interest  you didnt even bargain with the guy
maybe  but no one ever advertised before
this might do  i dont know  it just seems kind of pricey for a fixerupper dont you think  were trying to keep our costs down  you know how it is when youre starting a new company
do you think its wide enough  how much
good idea  were any other words spoken that you remember
it wasnt a date  it was an investigation
do you know when that might be  were on the brink of a very serious cashflow problem
no sense worrying about it now
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy
where are you pete
sit tight  im on my way
dont move  it wont hurt you
i dont know  im just guessing
i cant take much more of this  the pace is killing me
its not good pete
no  nobody ever built them like this  the architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius  the whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy
hes listed on the blueprints as i shandor
i dont think its shandor
well that ought to do it
forget the trapping  just blast him
what  what popped in there
the staypuft marshmallow man  he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid  we used to roast staypuft marshmallows at camp waconda
yeah i heard that  now tell me what you really do
uh  oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barretts apartment building  and theyre most unusual
mmmhmmm
boy  solid cores of shielded selenium 325
no  but i liked jesus style
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesiumtungsten alloy
and the seas would boil 
judgement day 
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world
right  well believe anything
later man
what do you mean choose  we dont understand
were nearly there lucilla
will you please get back in your wagon  and stay there
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed
and caesar  lets not forget to serve caesar
why  then theyll notice when im gone  well  im making a public appearance arent i
maybe you should get married  pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability
if you get me pregnant with a boy hell be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne
im sure i dont know
let some time pass then ask quietly without anyone knowing it comes from me
i want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house  if its worth something then sell it
commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father  except that he cant heave out his ghost
if i may be so bold
why not do it in the colosseum
you cant do that  you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you
youre coming back
taking my pleasure  do i need to clear my lovers with you
why are you so surly  youve won brother  the people have bread and the city is quiet
the fans of narcissus  they were on vigil outside the school of proximo they believe hes dying
what are you talking about
if i ever loved narcissus it wasnt like you want
yes  go on
you cant do that listen to the mood of the crowd
you want control of the crowd  you cant get it by killing their hero
not yet dear brother
do you want posters too
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands
respectfully caesar quintus and i must report
thats difficult to say general
gladly caesar
oh but with the army behind you you could become extremely political  not a republican by any chance
the dangerous man caesar is the man who doesnt care
do we really need to repair this fort  it seems like an expensive undertaking  i propose we burn it to the ground  that way if the germans cross the danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position
you flatter me caesar
caesar
we have to stop the germans now
they wont break this one
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate  i could have executed you
on what charge
if you set me free i will find my way back to the army march on rome and depose you  then the army and i will restore the republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again
quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory  they will hear that you are living in luxury he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life and soon the army wont even remember your name
how can they  who else is there  i have no heir
ignore that  the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
until your confirmation date
at the opening of the month of janus i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship
yes  you know thats not a bad idea
im serious
we can crush gaius another way what if you do throw something to the people they really want  make them a gift of food
sacks of grain even bread  i own the grain licenses for the military i can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the danube
make a gift to the people  its your money anyway so its only fair
i wouldnt know who to bet on
im certain father will be in better humors by then  now honor us with your presence at dinner  ill join you as soon as i see my fathers physician
he left us at dawn
i met with falco and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans
narcissus will never support you caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament
underdog  how can he be an underdog  he wins all the time  im the emperor why cant i kill him  he could be poisoned or somehow killed to look like an accident
where is the emperor and the army soldier
he must have been  he was on the list of prisoners to be executed
caesar i did my best  the colosseum isnt under my control
jerses  tomorrow
yes caesar
this is cos this precocious young man  a scribe for the daily action  ive invited him to write a small piece about you
commodus hes a gladiator is he mad
i dont know
ill nose around
thats their job isnt it  to argue  so i think my case will be long on talk and short on action
the exact month when the emperor must be confirmed
that makes his birth sign virgo why thats the sign of a little girl  can you tell my readers more about your starcrossed connection with emperor commodus
yes because i know theyll read it
god of passages and changes
you know general there is a gate of janus in rome which is only closed in time of peace  sadly it has remained open for three hundred years
but have never been
yes  the days of imperial prerogative and disdain for the senate are over  thanks to your father  now report to the senate master galen  what is marcus state
the trouble is defining exactly what right is
the moment you returned from the battle your options were clear  if you are a friend to neither side legate you must be an enemy to both  we needed to know what you believed
youre hearing about somebody else
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
you dont know how wrong you are
why you
fools to let us both live well be our own best witnesses at our trial
they cant if this is rome
narcissus  terrified  you  the only thing hes scared of is me
only from a distance
sneaking around with your brother
im not fit for the job and as a matter of fact im not taking the job
why do you play at being drunk
i dont believe that  hes got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron  you know were preparing for a fullblown invasion of germany
yours will do
you mean a symbol of someone who doesnt exist
for the sake of the gods youre not leading these men  how like my father you are  you believe i guess thats why youre still alive
do you remember your epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children  the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans
but what if i wish to be purple
would that marcus had lived
he killed his father and then my family
hidden  where my brother cannot place hands on them  he didnt have the guts to watch them die so i took care of it all  the sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when theyre most vulnerable
i will marcus  but youre going to be well enough to direct it yourself
theres no reason to say that everyone knows youre going to be well  i had servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light
hes like you sir too tough for the gods to swallow
commodus is just a young man hell learn what you had to learn
so i understand
youre too hard on him  he is a strong young man with you as his guide
marcus you honor me but im a soldier politics scare the hell out of me
they fear me
ill do anything in my power to help you restore the republic but i cant be that power
much more colorful than the ones we wear  and of course less dented
tomorrow
on your honor as a roman officer daddy
lets hope he doesnt start giving orders
what the hell do you think it was about  theres nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others
well we can try
centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the germans will try one last offensive  theyve got nothing to lose and its so very like them
what deal
my troops dont make policy
i cant let you do that
i was summoned
its my job to keep my job  and that by the way is now head of praetorian guard  good ole tribuus has been retired
you seem to be doing a great job of it singlehand  narcissus the republic is dead  you think those senators could govern  for the last hundred and fifty years theyve worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses
the people listen to the people they know what they want  a government that gives them what they need and doesnt bother them with messy thoughts of issues  you know messy thinking  they want a dictator  as far as the children there is only one thing that every roman child dreams of  being you a famous gladiator
can you stop that slaughter  can you free these men
isnt the helmet magnificent
greeks
theyre studying with cynics
i can see that
if you win you know you have to stay  its the losers who get to go home  besides im not so sure it is over  centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines
ive been overseeing production myself for the past three years youll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become
who else  im the one who runs the estates while youre here risking everything we have for the glory of rome  or for the glory of you
we dont need your help were doing great on our own
let him trust quintus
i never knew a more idealistic man than you
i dont even want to imagine the things youve seen
no
how long do you think commodus will let us live once hes in power  a month  half a year  paestum will be a prison where hell hold us until its time
do you want to see themis and manto butchered  if i die fighting commodus he wont care about you if i live ill come and get you
your daughters need more than some vapors they need you
you teach them
i killed too many barbarians
i am the man who might save your life  give you a bit more life at any rate  i am proximo palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me  i own this school and everything thats in it  youre in it  but why  what did a roman general do to get himself condemned to the colosseum understand we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets  please i separated you from the others because   my nose tells me youve been condemned for important reasons
general all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
you are to be killed exactly theyll give you a sporting chance but just enough to make your murder entertaining  romans like to mix their metaphors  laughter with their executions you know  if you survive though you will become a gladiator  a gladiator at least gets a fair fight
death is everything for me  now you have to go to your cell and i to dicker with jerses youll be fed well  i want you to be fit as you can be i want you to win for me tomorrow  i want all my gladiators to win and be happy  besides ive never owned a roman general before
chain him
i refuse to be your slave  i refuse 
im not a gladiator  i refuse to fight
i didnt get killed and everyone else did
what would the poster say narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil
alive im alive
dont be ridiculous
lucky it didnt step on his head
make us rich proximo make us very rich
what the hell are you talking about greek
so i pretend im dead  you get gold what do i get
as what the galloping gladiator
spend my days beheading country bumpkins  i dont know proximo who has better wine than you besides im beginning to think of the colosseum as my home
pressures on eh proximo  theres got to be a load of money in this why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window
on you  of course  you are my bravest fighter  the best fighter i have ever seen
oh shit  take your time  dont get suckered  this man is a murderer  in his career hes killed over a thousand gladiators  please just take the fall
a great deal  they designed and build tigers chariot
i can really rape them on this  can i at least tell them youll think about it
fantastic  wonderful  but posters are very expensive
right right but theyll have to bring in a lawyer  i dont want to get sued over this
right right what am i thinking of
ill do it  sure as theres shit in the tiber were all going to die but for you  anything
you were a soldier and then a gladiator werent you
i want nothing to do with the arena
are you mad  with all this unrest the colosseum will be open day and night  anyway im not political im in the entertainment business

oh yeah thats that
why yes mr dillon heres a potential new neighbor looking at
sickness comes to us all mister dillon

why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby
its a rune  thorn
black magic   in ancient times thorn was believed to cause sickness famine and death translated literally it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices  on the celtic celebration of samhain
when applied directly to another person thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction  to literally visit them with the devil
to find the rest of your family before michael myers does  or whoevers been controlling him
mrs blankenship have you seen the little boy who came in with me and 
hes gone
kara no
wait a minute 
its not working
thats the whole idea of living in the country  i thrive on the seclusion
i hope you didnt come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud
but surely rogers isnt 
you should know that its not wise to play halloween pranks on me
please try to understand terence ive already made up my mind
you dont know that for sure  it could have been anyone  a practical joke kids
after six years  sam she died with him in that explosion after the 
or whats left of him

no dr loomis  shes not the last night
no one
only me    and dr wynn
no
i dunno boy
its a bitch
didnt recognize you
i wonder wholl recognize us first theyll wet their pants
im gonna wet my pants
one thing anywayat least penelope didnt throw out all your crap  i bet alice threw out all my crap after id been gone a week
home  jesus  im like this  home
you know what gets me
how all the magazines show tits today
used to be against the law didnt it
must have changed that law
you know what gets me
oh shit
looseleafwill you get the hell home
at least
its enough that youve brought yourself home
tell them yourself
after eight years in the jungle with you i know mrs wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs wheeler
this room is full of ghosts
go home
the hell with the diamonds
go home  show them how rich you are for a change
take the cadillac and drive it off a cliff for all i care
ill buy a hundred more cadillacs go home
go home
go home
thats the point  walk in there and find whatever there is to findbefore alice can cover it up
so long colonel
lets talk about it some other time
good night colonel  its been beautiful
leave me alone  after eight years of horrendously close association the time has come to part  i crave solitude and time for reflection and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood  you and i may not meet again for months
im certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow and i will not welcome your horning back into mine  a chapter has ended  we are old comradesat a parting of the ways
go home
youre right  well take a trip a trip is what well take  i dont want to talk about motorcycles  i dont want to talk about tits  go home
lets talk about something else
i sure didnt expect her to drop dead
first nagasakinow this
the educational process
she was about to get married again she locked me out of the bedroom last night
you know me boy
one of them is the doctor whose weapons are compassion unselfishness peacefulness maudlin concern
he and his love are like a retiarius  do you know what a retiarius is
how do you know that
when
oh  id forgotten
really
sorry
of course  not only go to it but go to it in full uniform  rent a uniform
wear your uniform and every decoration and let them despise you if they dare
when i was a naive young recruit in spain i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos  i now understand it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform uncontrollable fear  to our women
the world is teeming with women ours to enjoy
it helped more than you know  down deep people were deeply affected
hes a man  tell him youre a man
i dunno
sorry  at least youve got a place to come back to  i dont have a place to come back to anymore
i dunno you know  i used to really love that alice do you know that
i dunno
shut up you ninny  you were never to come here again for any reason whatsoever
whats this
in what way pray tell
tit for tatas simple as that
you did
maybe its time you got out
you
youre an imbecile
everybody thinks that
the one direct decisive intelligent act of your life
if what
they were enemies  we were at war
goodbye looseleaf
how are you honeybunch
the posies are for her
youve come to the right man
i forget mine for years on end
our pleasure
for seven and a half of those years we were heavily druggedor we would have been home long before now believe me  we were saved from starvation by the lupiloopo indians who fed us a strange blue soup
it sapped our willmade us peaceful and unenterprising  it was a form of chemical castration we became two more sleepy indians
id rather go to viet nam
what you say is pass the fucking catsup
you actually sold insurance
get used to it  back door paul
ive considered that
i just want one true adventure before i die
youre making a joke
its engineered to last about fifteen years
never mind the condition of your body and your spirit  look after your things your things
what
for what
do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman
to make an ass of yourself
were ahead of schedule thats all youre finding out here what you would have found out in africa that you are a rabbit born to be eaten alive
it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us
youre hollow like a woman
he can shoot  he can hold his ground  he can attack  youre in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives closet drunkards every one
look how youre acting now  this is a moment of truth and youre almost crying  slug me
out  out
out
thank god
as a matter of fact
as a matter of facti am home
hello
are youdo you
do you know who wanda june is
do you mind if i ask who you are
dr woodly
is anybody besides you here now
wheres mom
she went to the fight with herb shuttle i guess
ill see
i was going to a funny movie but i changed my mind  if youre depressed laughing doesnt help much  when did you know my father
everybody says he was so brave
he worships father
hes a vacuum cleaner salesman
she met him at college
they were in the same creative writing class
she has a masters degree in english literature
he insults him all the time
whats good about that
he doesnt do it in front of me but he does it with mother  you know what he called father one time
harold the patron saint of taxidermy
nothing  he plays a violin in a doctors quartet
he was a stretcherbearer in the korean war  were you in a war with father
tell me some true stories about dad
england
dad was never in england
the sting
the sting
tell me that
tell me that  tell me that
wow
mhravitch
uck
i dont know
go on
where did you get the poison
and one of them was the beast of yugoslavia harold the beast was upstairs and he came running downstairs for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testamentseditorializing about the hospitality they had received  and your father said to him in perfect german which he had learned in the spanish civil war major something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard  i am harold ryan of the united states of america  you i believe are the beast of yugoslavia
mhravitch
when i grow up im going to go to mhravitch
sir
i wanted to go out for football but mom was afraid id get hurt
dr woodly says hes seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football  he says that when theres a war everybody goes but football players
theyre not engaged
oh no no no no no  it cant be how embarrassing
no no no no no
go ahead  no no no no
sir
is looseleaf harper alive
shes a real heavy sleeper sometimes
i cant take my eyes off you
cant it keep till morning
thats nice  you thank her for me go to bed and get lots of sleep and then you thank her in the morning
penelope
penelope
will you go to bed
scat
damn
your mother and i do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours
the smallest thing ive got
make it fast
couldnt you have vanished quietly out the back door
leave a tip
beat the shit out of someone who hates you
weve got to do something to make this boys voice change  i wonder if we couldnt get bull balls somewhere and fry em up  still miss your mother
youre free to go to her if you want  if youd rather be a woman and run with the women just say the word
who was it
whats this
nothing
no
no
pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamberwhere it belongs
welcome to manhood you little sparrowfart  load that gun
too late  its man to man now protecting your mother from me are you  protect her
i dont want to fight you
its your house dad
im talking to you gently now
i am harold ryan her husband  i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sortsas a professional soldier  i have killed thousands of other animals as wellfor sport
heaven
i think so daughter  how old are you
a springbok an oryx a gemsboka gazelle
raw hamburger pleaseand a whole onion  i want to eat the onion like an apple  do you understand
what time do you get off work my child
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire
daughteri love you very much
you are woman  i know woman well
destiny often seems that way youre going to marry me
my parents died in an automobile accident when i was sixteen years old  they left me a brewery and a baseball teamand other things  i live for a living  ive just come back from kenyain africa  ive been hunting mau mau there
the pelt is black  its a kind of man
how do you do mrs ryan  id heard you were beautiful and so you are  am i intruding here
i couldnt help overhearing that you were about to get married again
give us time
give us time haroldto adjust to your being alive
we adjust to what there is to adjust to  perhaps paul being young can adjust to joy or grief immediately  i hope he can  i will take a little longer  ill be as quick as i can
i dont know  this is a new disease to me
situation
a telegrama phone call might have helped
wellenjoy the natural honest unrehearsed resultsurgical shock
every fuse in my nervous system has been blown
youd better get dr woodly
we thought a doctor might help
we thought it was an emergency
hes a very decent man harold
shouldnt you lie down
paul said you were awfully sick
nothing would please me more
have some
i could carve a better man out of a banana
you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles  you know who filled that bag for you  not alicesitbythefires like yourself  men with guts filled it by godmen with guts enough to pay the price for miraclessuffering ingratitude loneliness death
he thought he could take my place it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i dont think hes man enough to do that
say hello to your mother
ghastly cruel unnecessary
i did
a trip you mean
buy yourself breakfast  there we go
its soso stark
justbangwe have a honeymoon
turn around
you shouldnt have talked to norbert that way
i have a brain
ram it up your ass
scrambled eggs kippered herring fried potatoesand a whole onion i want to eat the onion like an apple  do you understand
mrs wheeler is dead
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips
bring me a side order of mrs wheeler
what a honeymoon
youre wrong
were all going to have to go out for breakfast  the cook quit yesterday
people dont use that word any more
you leave me soso without without dignity
they dont have to feel like slaves
ii was wonderingis there anything you shouldnt eatbecause of jungle fever
no
i do not wish to be scroggedever i never heard that word but when i heard it i knew it was one thing i never wanted to have happen to me
this is not a coy deception  i do not want to be scrogged  i want love  i want tenderness
i will not be scrogged  i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers and you promised me that the fish couldnt feel
id like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours
well i can  some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me  im not a silly carhop any more  maybe youre right about fish when i was a carhop i didnt feel much more than a fish would  but ive been sensitized  i have ideas nowand solid information  i know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you
the whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots
its complicated and i dont want to go into it now because its bound to sound insultingeven though nobody means for anybody to be insulted  its just the truth
wellpart of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long and make awful messes while theyre there
and they have very mixed feelings about women  they hate them in a way  one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently  they can scrog them as you say  for revenge
i learned a lot of things in college  actuallyit was norbert who told me that
yes
his most cherished possession  his violin i guess
yes
i dont think so
what are you going to do
no youre not
because if you doill leave you harold  goodbye
sneaking in the back door
your clothes are at the city dump by now  perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation
if he wants to go
hed never seen a corpse  hes seen a dozen now
its a big and busy funeral home
it isnt a matter of liking  its a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing would you mind leaving  no woman ever walks out on harold ryan and then comes backfor anything
more nerve than the doctor i must admit  he hasnt been home for two days  has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color televisionand the violin
im dying to hear of his reaction the thrill of smashing something isnt in the smashing but in the owners reactions
about a broomstick and a cigar boxand the attenuated intestines of an alley cat
he feels awful losswhich was precisely my intention
hope
you feel ive done a dreadful thingleaving him
almost a christmas scene
just one favor
i want you to tell me that you loved me once
i see
how unhappy hes going to bealone in his room
rifle
hes in east st louis with his mothervisiting an aunt
hes afraid of you harold  he knew youd want to fight him  he doesnt know anything about fighting  he hates pain
it seems highly intelligent to me
blue soup
sounds quite beautiful
like what
with an iron penis three feet long load it boy
if he thinks hes man enough
im teaching my son to be a man
i plan to live one hundred years
if thats the casewhats to prevent my killing myself
what a handsome word
if youve lived a good life fought well
may i continue with the rearing of my son  load that gun
i feel mocked insulted with no sort of satisfaction in prospect we dont have to fight with steel i can fight with words  im not an inarticulate ape you know who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary  call him up in east st louis penelope  tell him to come here
no
i dont know  i hope he never hunts  i hope he never kills another human being
dont
stop
there has to be a threat of some sort nobility of some sort glamour of some sort sport of some sort  these elements are lacking
ah  the lady is armed
whoever has the gun you see gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do  its the american way
then youd better fix your bayonet because there arent any bullets in the gun
there it is  give it to me
load it for her
the national safety council would be appalled
out
youve killed women
of course he can goif hell just go down on his hands and knees for a momentand promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree
ooops
gentlementhats nice
its always locked
youreyoure old friends of harold ryan
hes dead you know
hello mother
oh dear
well miss you so
oh oh ohi thought it was your apartment  you seemed at home here
ahhthen shes still alive
and still mrs harold ryan
she still has just the one child the boy
and what exactly is your relationship to mrs ryan
and you come into mrs ryans apartment as often as you please looking into various health matters
and her fianc
ive got to run
ive literally got to run
i came back
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab
areare you crying penelope
what next  you leave promptly of course  there is no question as to whose home this is
whose son this is whose wife that is  a fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time  good night
what a brilliant diagnosis
i know malaria  malaria isnt caused by the bites of bats
colonel harper and i once shared a treetop with a family of bats there was a flash flood  there were piranha fish in the water thats how colonel harper lost his little toe
chills fevers sweats  you can describe it and name it after yourself the woodly galloping crud
i was going to ask
would you say that again
ive never heard of it
are youve seen it work cures
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people  curare ephedrineweve found some amazing things
thats an editorial we of course i havent turned up anything personally
i can just hear the editorial wee weeweeing when looseleaf and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root  i can hear the alicesitby thefires now we discovered it in the amazon rain forest  now we cure you with it  now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks
you were wrong you quack
what for
this little corpse is intended as a lesson
lest we forget how cruel you are
its healer to killer  is that the same thing
the same hairy humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon honor  if you like
yes
correct
you havent heard me yet
well find out now wont we
oooooo  that hurt
now whos being cruel
we do survive dont we  youre going to have to apologize of course for calling me a bastard thats a matter of formnot allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard  no rush about that just remember to apologize sometime soon
yeswelluhthats another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology  whenever you feel like it its sort of like turning off an alarm clock thats ringing loudly your apology turns off the alarm
comical
and terror if you dont mind
im high as a kite
youre a clown  youre a clown who killsbut youre a clown
evolution has made you a clown with a cigar  simple butchers like you are obsolete
if youre at home in the ooze and nowhere else
youre not such a creature of the ooze that youd hurt an unarmed man
king arthur
in any event i will not beg for mercy
dont you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew
ive struck my blow
ive poisoned you harold  lucretia borgia  something i drank or touched  you refused a cigar  thats it potassium cyanide in the humidor treacherous lover of peace
poison
ii really must congratulate you something is happening in there
no woodly the magic root you gave mei had it analyzed  it was discovered by a harvard botanist in 1893  he explored your famous jungle for five years armed with nothing but kindness a talent for languages and a pocketknife
you arent going to hurt me  you arent going to hurt anybody any more  any violent gesture will seem ridiculousto yourself
my violin is avenged
and the hell with it  it was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed
i hate crowds and i have no charisma
but the new hero will be a man of science and of peacelike me hell disarm you of course  no more guns no more guns
never  for when you began to kill for the fun of it you became the chief source of agony of mankind
im utterly satisfied
more clowning  dont you see
youd be killing a friend  dont you know how much i like you
no
new dignity can be yoursas a merciful man  you can change
oh godyoure really going to kill me harold it wont hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee  heaven is very much like paradise they say youll like it there
if you want to be found that way
man as man was meant to bea vengeful ape who murders  he will soon be extinct  its time its time
ive enjoyed being man
get up
have it your way  wed both be better off dead now
thank god harold crawl home
its trash now like mine
somewhere in this city  not here not here  tell penelope i loved herin my clownish way  and paul tell him to be a healer by all means
use the sanitary facilities if i may
ill put it in pauls room where it belongs
for what its worth now harold ryan the clown gives his sacred word
colonel harper retired now dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war killing seventyfour thousand people in a flash
you dont know
thank you  you can leave now  well begin
i dunno  yeah  yeah  yeah  i did

anywhere but here  id just sit here and cry about the way my fathers been forgotten
who have you been talking to
aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
no
fathers friend
dont know
that man is your father
there stands the loins from which youve sprung
it is you isnt it harold
dr woodly  you know who this is
shivers and sweats and groans  his teeth chatter  whatll we do
he can hardly talk
it is an emergency isnt it
then get him
youre taking mom out tonight
oh
a monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat
i apologize  but you didnt know him and neither did i  hows your asthma
hows the fungus around your thumbnail
its jungle rot  this room is making everybody sick  this is your family doctor speaking now  herei brought you something else to hang on your wall for the sake of variety
keeps fairies away
maybe its supposed to end now maybe god wouldnt have it any other way
he isnt any friend of father
he is my father
hes not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom
doing what
or was  we havent done anything wrong you know
thats something i suppose
im glad
i know
i dont want to go to vanderbilt
something happens to my confidence
when harold is definitely out of the picture penelope when i dont have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or paul wrong  im going to ask you to be my wife
thats when ill get my confidence back
if youll pardon the expression thats when youll see the fur and feathers fly  good night
women are always late  youll find out
beautiful  ive never seen that coat
we could have had some kind of birthday party for him  we could have taken paul to the fight with us
yeah
far as i know
he ditched me  he started running and i started running then he lost me in the park
its dark in there penelope and thats where he is
you figure
a what
how nice
before he started to run  he said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neckand someday wed all hear the sound of that key in the door
he said one other thing  it wasnt very nice
he told me to take a flying fuck at the moon
we got a birthday cake kid  did you see the cake
how long has this been going on
i feel as though i had been made a perfect chump of
marry me instead
youre saying no
i didnt make my move fast enough thats it isnt it  i was too respectful
whats so wonderful if i lost the sale  you poor kid
wellit was nice while it lasted thanks for the memories
hes the most wonderful guy i ever met penelope  hes the most complicated guy i ever met  i cant believe it but hes going to take me to africa with him
would you like to say something about killing colonel
take plenty of cigars
i must take you to an emergency ward sometimeon a saturday night thats also fun  i came to see selma as a matter of fact
im glad somebody finally cried every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death i want to cry  i dont cry of course  not manly you know  did she try antihistamines
throw out all this junk  burn it this room crawls with tropical disease
no doubt paul thinks it stinks
what
tonights the night
it is
as long as he keeps out of the park
the only thing i ever told him about life was keep out of the park after the sun goes down
thats the xke
its an experimental model  he doesnt dare leave it in his car for fear it will fall into the hands of competition
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was he made eagle scout when he was twentynine years old  oh norbertpromise me that paul has not gone into the park
no  oh no  three people murdered in there in the last six weeks the police wont even go in there any more
its suicide
meaning
why would you do that
im amazed
and maybe paul  what about the murderers  theyre in there
pauls only twelve years old
weve got to rescue him
hes not your son
its a jungle out there
hed go to a movie  i think thats what hed do  if i were sure he was in a movie i could stop worrying  we could have him paged
we met here earlier this evening
i believe in miracles now
tell her to have a nice trip
its really that bad
ohlook at the poor crucified violin would you
you fake  youre no better than the dumbest general in the pentagon  youre not going to beat harold youre not going to beat anybody youre not going to stay here eitheryammering and taunting until youre most gloriously killed go home
goodbye
im glad you brought your vacuum cleaner
that maid just quit  the place is a mess  you can start in the master bedroom
not true
thats not true eitheror neednt be unless we make it true
which we do  but we can stop doing that
penelope  were late
im sick of this argument  i just have one more thing to say if you elect a president you support him no matter what he does  thats the only way you can have a country
none of my relatives are chinese communists  speak for yourself
you can believe that if you want i talk to guys like you and i want to commit suicide  you get that weightlifting set i sent you
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be rebornso he or she can see how it ends  even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earthto see how it ends theyre all on times squaremaking change for peepshows  or recruiting marines
he died of a massive rupture
youre preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of dubuque  take care of your body yes  but dont become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes  dont become obsessed by your musculature  any one of these poor dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be their magic was in their muscles your magic is in your brains
its good  let him go
dont  let him have all the privacy he wants  let him grieve let him rage  there has never been a funeral for his father
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage
then wed stay home and eat venison or something and look through the scrapbooks  ive got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat  im going to bring that boy back
we can take off the wanda june with a butter knife

oh im so happy you said that because i wanted to show you my paintings this is the rape of rome and of course there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of leda and the swan
yes very much
subways perfume cigarette   cologne carpet chestnuts  usnowu
thats really great
oh eh i like it

sterling silver it was my dear motherinlaws part of a dinner set of fifty pieces its one of the few things that survived  oh but i do rattle on so tell me about yourself harold  what do you do when you arent visiting funerals
what do you mean
i dont know just one of those 
because they are all the same
oh its only a machine harold its not as if it were ualiveu like a horse or a camel we may live in a machine age but i simply cant treat them as equals  of course the age has its advantages
well
look
over there by the courthouse
that little tree its in trouble come on
but what
but we cant just dig it up
but this is public property
yes youre right well go see glaucus come on
is he all right
what is that hes working on
it is kind of rough
look the ice is melting
well i really dont drink
some nuts some licorice it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait
my umbrella  oh thats just a relic i found it when i was packing to come to america it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings  being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition  a long time ago
oh big issues liberty rights justice kings died and kingdoms fell i dont regret the kingdoms  what sense in borders and nations and patriotism  but i do miss the kings when i was a little girl i was taken to the palace in vienna to a garden party i can still see the sunshine the parasols and the flashing uniforms of the young officers i thought then i would marry a soldier  later frederick would chide me about it  he was so serious a doctor at the university and in the government
no more revolts
well i dont
but i dont play anything
superb
is he ah the police always wanting to play games well here goes
the old double uturn gets them every time
i dont know
yeah and it is cold in here hello glaucus
yes its almost there
yes
why therell be a new block of ice in the morning
yes so do i but i think he is a little oldfashioned like a puff harold
its all right  its organic
vice virtue its best not to be too moral you cheat yourself out of too much life aim above morality as confucius says dont simply be good make good things happen
well    they say he was very wise so im sure he must have
me  when i look around me i know i know nothing i remember though once long ago in persia we met a wise man in the bazaar he was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay his specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin the wisest he said the truest the most instructive words for all men at all times frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel i peered through a magnifying glass to read the words  and this too shall pass away  well the wise man was right  if you remember that you cant help but live life fully
what was that
how ingenious tell me about them
of course
i like you maude
its so blue
spreckled with uncountable stars the stars are shining right now we just cant see them just another instance of all thats going on that is beyond human perception
pray no  i communicate 
with life
well why dont you

well theyre my species
yes theyre old friends
i dont know perhaps
we uareu alone  you and me and everybody but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them too someone we dont know and most likely will never see  that someone is breathing along with us and the star gazers of the past  from peasant to princes  and the stargazers of the future  all of us breathing and looking up there we are alone  but look at the stars and never feel lonely
oh no but i should have liked to have been an astronaut a private astronaut able to just go out and explore like the men who sailed with magellan i want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world  what a joke it will be if like them i 
maude
here
i took them out
they mocked me they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings  but sharp photographs so i tossed them out my memory fades i know but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling and not by kodak with silver nitrate
harold that picture is almost twentyfive years old
youve never cried before i never thought you would i thought despite anything you could always be happy

thats right  kevin  shes mrs kevin bannister  she lives in australia
i beg your pardon
it wont go any louder
i dont want to hear public enemy right now
i dont want old sad bastard music either  i just want something i can ignore
yeah well its fucking monday afternoon  you should get out of bed earlier
whats next
say it
since when did this shop become a fascist regime
great  thats the fun of working in a record store  playing crappy pap you dont want to listen to  i thought this tape was going to be you know a conversation stimulator i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that and you just had to ruin it
well whats the point in that
rob  top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the 80s and 90s  subquestion  is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins  is it better to burn out than to fade away
we didnt even really have it  i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is dont drive drunk i was just goofing on the straight and it never cost you a penny
oh so whats the point then
our customers you think that mr ll bean out there is going to be a regular
bullshit  the guy was going to buy one record  which we didnt even have  and leave and never come back again anyway  why not have a little fun  big fucking deal
he offended me with his terrible taste
oh now youre defending that motherfucker  youre going soft in your old age rob  there was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street  now all of a sudden im offending your golf buddy  youre right rob  i am so sorry how are we ever going to make enough money to get you and laura into the country club
but now i kind of like it
i wanna live with a musician  shed write songs at home ask me what she thought of them maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes
i didnt know it was classified information  i mean i know we dont have any customers but i thought that was a bad thing not like a business strategy
thats fucking great barry  we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each  fantastic barry
its not my car now is it  its lauras car and thus laura has it so its an assbumping double transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab wow  fucking great
what do you mean what
im not snickering  im smiling because im happy
ehh
oh no rob thats not obvious enough not at all  dick did you hear that
ooh  a kind of recent record  robs sly declaration of new classicstatus slipped into a list of old classics nice lets get it on couldnt you make it more obvious than that
 youre like a little squirrel of music storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music musical lint old shit shit shit 
to me it would mean that youre a liar  you saw it twice  once with laura  oops  once with me and dick  we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo offscreen in the fourteenth century
no but would you think from that one sentence  that i was going to see it
just listen to me  if i said to you 
would you would you get the impression that i wanted to see it
but in your opinion would i definitely go
because its a brilliant film  its funny violent and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass
lets pack it up  we havent had a customer in four hours
ha
how do you know about that
yeah you would say that wouldnt you  you two have to stick together now  boners united  united in getting some
suck my ass
what the fuck is that
what band
you are not in a band barry  you are not a musician  and no posters
barrytown  barrytown  is there no end to your arrogance
you cant be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown
thats why you got the gig isnt it
that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally yes but 
how many tickets can i put you down for
youre not even coming
so much for friends then  youre a bitter bastard rob you know that
laura  her dad died
whatever  okay tell laura i love her thatd bring the house down lauras mom could sing it
id want one step beyond by madness and you cant always get what you want
havent seen it
oh  right  but id forgotten about that  i wasnt biting the idea
no way
what
so  you even said theyre good
laura said we could  if we helped out with the posters and stuff  and we did  and we are
were getting that anyway
no  we need the gig
were not as bad as you think rob
were not called barrytown anymore by the by  they got sick of the barrybarrytown thing  were called sdm  sonic death monkey
what do you think  dick likes it
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge rob and this group does exactly that  over the edge in fact
thats what we want  reaction  and if lauras bourgeois lawyer friends cant take it then fuck em  let em riot we can handle it  well be ready
oh yeah  we got it
no you cant
because its sentimental tacky crap thats why not  do we look like the kind of store that sells i just called to say i loved you go to the mall and stop wasting our time
do you even know your daughter there is no way she likes that song or is she in a coma
i have all of the others
they always seemed
do not get ahead of yourself
i have a television
its the new 
no  the righteous brothers
nothing
nothing  i just prefer the other one
isnt her album called number four with a smile
no no no you said the number four with a smile and theres no the at the front of the title of the album
you can be and are wrong
on clark street
we work there
why
nobody
anna who  anna green gables  anna conda
anna moss  mossy  the mossy thing the swamp thing  is she all green and furry
hes not worth it
did you know that after that song was recorded jan himself crashed his 
no  no  mom wants you to come to the funeral  its on friday
oh hi
the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite  do you have an appointment
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary  thats all
im looking for deejay rob gordon
im caroline fortis from the reader i want to do a story on you
well i used to go to the dodger on your nights and i saw youre doing it again and that your putting out a record and its sort of a thenand now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now
i thought i would ask you a few questions if thats okay
so  is now a good time
yeah  i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it
pardon me
oh boy in the club or at home
of course well yeah a bit sin city by the flying burrito brothers is an alltime top five but i wouldnt play it at the club  its a countryrock ballad  everybodyd go home
what do you mean four more
can i go home and work this out and let you know  in a week or so
fine  thats great
well i wouldnt mind a quick chat if you got the time
thats five  so  why did you decide to deejay again
nice friend
whats his name
music for old people what does that mean
oh you know a lot of people arent too old for clubs but theyre too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that  they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and theres nowhere for them
oh well the kinky wizards are  you know what  why dont i just make you a tape
haha  right  its no problem  i love making tapes
yeah sure
yeah  a billion  right how are you
uhyes at the moment
hey rob
fuck  i knew it  youre going through one of those whatdoesit allmean things
theres been a rash of them recently i find it a little unnerving  in fact marco called a few months back and he wanted to see me and rehash the past as they say and i wasnt really up for it  do all men go through this
did you tell that to marco when he did his whatdoesitallmean thing with you
oh hi  hi rob
yeah ok  i found the first licorice comfits album at vintage vinyl  the one on testament of youth  never released here  japanese import only
ill tape it for you
cause you like their second one you said pop girls etc  the one with cheryl ladd on the cover  you didnt see the cover though
well ill just make it for you
the new belle and sebastian  like it
can i help you
yeah  im sorry look dick laura and i broke up  shes gone  and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that
fine
i understand dick
yeah
i want a tape
liz hold on a second   what
 fuck off
do it  do it
yeah but more than that  im happy because im proud of us  because although our talents are small and peculiar we use them to their best advantage
yeah well ill see you tomorrow rob
youre a horrible person barry  i mean it
abraham martin and john thats a nice one
its vince and justin
i am fine  i gotta go  goodbye
you look upset
maybe i should talk to him
conflict resolution is my job laura
hello rob  remember me  im ray ian
come on rob  my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal
we are not talking jokey understatement here rob  were talking actionable harassment  ten phone calls a night hanging around outside my house
weve noticed and were glad  but you know how are we going to make peace here  we want to make things easier for you  what can we do obviously i know how special laura is and i know things cant be good for you at the moment  id hate it if i lost her  but id like to think that if she decided she didnt want to see me anymore id respect that decision  do you see what im saying
good  so shall we leave it at that then
think about it rob
ive already left it you pathetic rebound fuck  now get your patchouli stink out of my store
we wont leave it ian  not ever
i dunno
weve done the hard part now  i might as well you know
i should be so lucky
hi
i thought i could give you a lift back
yes  well im coming over to your house to get some things
its not like saying that at all actually rob  art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records 
 whatever and the israelis and the palestinians dont  art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute and the israelis and the palestinians are art garfunkel and marvin gaye 
 and who says i like marvin gaye anyway
is that right  id like a word with him
i remember the song  i just couldnt remember who sang it
well i liked you  you were a deejay and i thought you were hot and i didnt have a boyfriend and i wanted one
yeah sure  more so then than i am now  thats life though isnt it
you really believe that
and do you like it that way
dont you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection
i think you know that
good  so  is it my job
i dont know  its one of the things i thought of
just the obvious stuff
i dont know
no
what what
no  so  is it working out with ian
why is that childish  your living with the guy  im just asking how its going
well then why dont you quit it while you seem to not be ahead
so what you havent definitely decide to dump me  theres still a chance well get back together
well if you dont know theres a chance right  its like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said i dont know if hes got a chance of survival or not then that doesnt mean the patients definitely going to die now does it  it means he might live  even if its only a remote possibility
so we have a chance of getting back together again
hey i just want to know where i stand  what chance 
okay okay we have a nine percent chance of getting back together does that clarify the situation
im too tired for this now  i know im asking a lot but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up  i need to be able to think while i do it and i cant think while youre here
fine  one
nevermind
just ask it
is what better  better than what
jesus christ rob  is that really whats bothering you
you really think it would make a difference either way
well the answer is that i dont know either  we havent done it yet
i havent felt like it
no  i was living with you remember weve slept together but we havent made love  not yet  but ill tell you one thing  the sleeping together is better
will you please just go
hi  ive been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and im thinking i didnt take them with me  have you seen them around
im sorry to call but i need that stuff
well talk some other time
have you slept with him yet
no not  i mean have you you know 
i guess
i want you to say that you havent and i want it to be the truth
you must have known it would happen you couldnt have been entirely unprepared  like you said ive been living with the guy  we were bound to get around to it sometime
nothing
look i gotta go  i work too you know
i dont have your number
you do huh
its me
i think the big question here is where are you if you dont mind my saying so and i think i know where you are  youre running  on the run  youre running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship and youre just going to hit it again with ian but its going to be with a world music bunny rabbitlooking earthshoewearing doctor whowatching twit who doesnt really understand you not the way that i do and will more in the future and youll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that youre in now only later and with him
jesus  i do not know  ill talk to you later
im not experimenting  why dont you go experiment
you dont ever think about other people
is that the last of it
those look heavy  wheres ian
it was kind of funny
you still together  going all right
that bad eh
ill bet you cant remember what you were doing here can you  i mean how much are you making now  sixty seventy  and you were living in this shitty place
im sorry but can we get this straight  what is his fucking name ian or ray  what do you call him
i hate him too  so i just call him mavis or sissyboy or mavis the sissyboy
you make me laugh much more than ray does if thats what youre getting at  but i already knew you could make me laugh  its everything else i dont know about
mmm hmm
oh ho so very infrequently
those arent mine
theyre not really though are they i know you bought them for me and that was really sweet of you but that was when you were trying to turn me into you  i cant take them i know theyd just sit around staring at me and id feel embarrassed by them and they dont fit in with the rest of whats mine do you understand  that sting record you bought for me that was a present for me  i like sting and you hate him  but the rest of this stuff  who the hell is nick lowe  or gram parsons  or the boredoms  i dont know these people  i
im sorry to go on about it  but i dont know theres a lesson here somewhere and i want to make sure you get it
youre being deliberately obtuse
well think about it
hey how ya doin
i cant talk right now
pigsty
pig died
my dad died  my dad my dad
no no  when are you going home
my dad liked you  and mom never told him wed split because he wasnt up to it and oh i dont know  i dont really understand it  i think she thinks hell be able to see whats going on  its like  hes been through so much what with dying and everything that she doesnt want to upset him any more than she has to
i dont care  as long as you dont expect me to hold your hand
yes of course
sure  ill see you on friday
uh no
mmnn
thank you  i appreciate it  i cant reciprocate
i didnt mess things up because i was scared  i slept with ray because i was sick of you  and i needed something to snap me out of it
i dont want to go back
cmon
i dont know  sometime  later listen rob would you have sex with me
i want to feel something else than this  its either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire  unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm
itll have to be sex then
hi
oh rob were not going to go through that again
yes of course  theres nothing to worry about
i lived with you  you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now youre worried i might kill you and youre entitled to worry  isnt that a terrible thing  isnt that sad
im too tired not to go out with you
everythings too hard  maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own but not now i dont
rays a disaster  i dont know what that was all about except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade i guess and blow it all apart
i know its not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage im sure  i just i need you rob  thats it  and we know each other and we care for each other and youve made it clear that you want me back so
okay
want to know what exactly
it was like sex  what else could it be like
whats the difference
look were okay now  we just had a nice time  lets leave it at that
well i was gonna lie and now i cant because youd know i was lying
to make you feel better
okay
hey great idea  what ill do is tomorrow ill get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley 78s on the sub label and ill pay for it that way
fantastic  the girlfriend lottery
but it wasnt supposed to be like this  when i met you we were the same people and now were not and
well you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger  you wore jeans and tshirts and so did i  and i still do and you dont
no but
but why doesnt it matter that were not the same people we used to be
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and
youre tougher
harder
im alright
youre being stupid
no use
hi  what are you doing
wanna go to dinner
at paul and mirandas  paul from work
i know  but youve never met  it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him
i tricked you into meeting some people youd think were great  i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way
has drag city records i know i know  you told dan koretzky about this
what
and the triumphant return of dj rob gordon triumphant return
you had no right  supposing i was doing something that couldnt be cancelled
thats not the point  i mean what if the single isnt done in time
barry  barry knows about this
its no joke  im responsible for what happens you know  embarrassment aside theres a lot of money and effort in this at least by my standards  i have to put down a deposit for the room  i have to pay the pressing plant for the records sleeve them sticker them 
thats okay  you seem pissed off all the time though

i must have nothing  their my husbands
hes in jamaica with a twentythree yearold  a friend of my daughters he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go minus a ten percent commission which reminds me  can you make sure you give me a five  i want to frame it and put it on the wall
years  this collection is as close as hes ever come to an achievement
that wasnt part of the deal  i want to be poisonous but fair
suit yourself  there are plenty of others who will
sixty
seventyfive
and i wont take a penny over ninety
im sorry but i think you better talk to someone else

okay  because you took the trouble to come up here  and because youve got principles  but thats it  im not selling them to you one by one
naw  those are for us
well we dont
no we
records are those big round black things right
wait a minute  island records charged u2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride
im vince

maybe hes hiding from something
dr kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral  the father looked just like richard  even had a mark on his cheek
pd says 41 but he barely looks 30
yeah
mr congeniality  let him find his own clues  theres a journal article in this somewhere
sure
go to hell
this one came unassembled
fine
didnt think it was my buddy over there
claymore
scottish claymore  take a french epee add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business and youve got a claymore
its in good condition
there was a count  count dusan  he would invite the local peasants to his chateau fill them full of wine then slice their bellies so he could reuse it  the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me
its my birthday
thanks
no thank you im fine
why
then you didnt know richard later on
ive been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies
i dont follow you
the boy died
there was this one fella  asked a lot of questions  i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office
carl smith
sos playing choochoo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of
you owe me  besides im cute
church hill thats pretty close isnt it
yes
id like to ask you about the claymore
its quite rare you know some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years
basil the ii
all but one out of a hundred i know  all left to be led like donkeys back home  now if you will please
good day miss cartwright
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries miss cartwright
probably
people like that rarely leave business cards
i think you do  better yet i dont think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place and i think mr smith whoever he is now knows that
ive been to church hill
i doubt that  good day miss cartwright
youll be safe here  he wont kill in a church
tradition
where
at the moment  carl smith
you neednt worry miss cartwright ive been at this a very long time
not your concern
that bothers you
hes dead  whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now
you
have you gone to the police
why not  im sure theyd love to hear your story
you are being foolish
go home
are you
no one knows youre here
you had to do nothing
youre a fool
youve been listening to rumors
you are  now
richard taupin has become cumbersome  it would be best if he just disappeared
not all of them
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr taupin
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property ive aquired  that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg  but thats where you come in
the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better  you as mrs taupin will attract considerably less attention than i
yes
it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg
yes
they do it each year
theres a catch  youre supposed to wear 19th century clothing
its beautiful
follow me
yes
yes
no  just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to  when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it twenty years later i became the son
at least
a factor of age
you wont
why are you here
i see
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer
you are a very perceptive young woman
that would be difficult to explain
thats why smith called you macleod
he knows about you
what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction
thats insane
of bodies
you killed those other two
what about that family in 31
you and your buddy make a real team dont you  exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between
you kill with your left hand
is that a threat
come here brenna
empty  and fear  fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you  it can never last and in the end you always end up destroying both
its all the same  half lives that never go away
all of it finished
will i see you again
i cant stand it  oh god i cant stand it
im the last  oh christ im the last one
no
the inheritance
you have lived forever
yes
im just curious
now theres a new topic
thanks
you better have a warrant  thats my notebook youve got no right to be sticking your fingers into it
what do you want from me
you and i should talk first
four
spare me the details
what are you getting at moran
itll never stick
youre an asshole moran
what makes you so sure hes the one
whats all of this got to do with me
research  if your pal was there i never saw him
never take up poker detective
all i need is for you to check the name
ill take care of that corey but i need this now
its that important
some job  card filing and cabinet dusting  four years in this dump and i havent written anything for wilson that a wounded yak couldnt do
its bullshit  everything my job the people i get involved with im up to here with it
not who  what  worsticks a town in pennsylvania
why
ive seen nobleman swords that werent as well preserved  its just a hunk of peasant iron  why would he be carrying it around in an alley
you see that desk  your desk  you see the crap piled up on it
what are you doing man
youll not be bringing the church into this
auditorium nostrum
in nomine sanctus esperitu
your name is conor
juan cid romirez  chief surveyor and alchemist
i am from spain  and i would like a moment of your time
please go to no trouble
five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member
i was nearly killed
and but for a mark you are well as any man no
i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation  and a solution
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew
first food no  a good meal makes conversation so much easier
pheasant
why are you here
youre a long way from inverness
you know me home  me name
you are the same
yes  always
it is less
i dont know why
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known the game  you and i conor we are different from all others around us  you know this you can feel it  we are flesh and bone like any man but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure  permanently
you are still so very young
not even a single lifetime
what
no
this is madness
no
this cant be
this is monstrous  ill burn in hell for all eternity
you will live  survive
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod
you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less
it is always less with my living far or near  but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before  there is power in this  and as long as you and i live the knight can never have it all
there is an imperfection  for all your healing if your head ever leaves your neck you are dead you can survive anything but steel against your threat  then it is over  the end
hide  run to the ends of the earth till you learn  you must learn to defend yourself  in this i can help
we are brothers  and you are a defense  of sorts
me arm hurts
go to hell
muy bien
its like to kill me first
and what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt
if that was meant to be an ex planation mr romirez from spain im afraid youve failed
point conceeded mr macleod
all living things pay dues conor  they must be respected for that
i do not think i like the sound of that
i feel hardly nothing
but why be so concerned about me
and you
i am not ready for this
of course
that is not me
ill be back when i can
i have no future husband
what are you saying  im standing here as real as you
but i did live
so why the crazy talk  its a miracle it is  saint andrew has smiled on me  on us
who
thats mad  surely you dont take their word
youre sounding like that mad woman widow baggins
ill not take that kind of talk from you  from those others below maybe  but not from you
youre not talking sense mara
do what you must
what would you like
like you
far away
do you have cause to bothering us
certainly not me
tradition
perhaps not  you seem to have misplaced a private  no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck
you surprise me  eliminating a rival like that  such are the actions of a man of conquest  i was mistaken  300 years have turned the boys fear into ambit ion
i know you very well conor macleod and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you  mulet romirez they were fools without vision  it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players
romirez is dust
finish yours
so sure
theyre nothing but boys  it will be a slaughter tomorrow
we need more time
not likely
mulet
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking
second musketeer
you seem to understand a great deal
excuse me sir  i thought we spoke as equals
if you wish to play games major
we have no understanding
it can be different  it must be
stay out of it
who do you think i am  one of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow  threaten you  you and i just living will always be a threat  forever  look at your life major  look at mine  nothing there but threat  threats and nothingness its what we live for

kahn

just your pappy scared some
why dont you fellows get your own news
a double guards been thrown around the jail municipal buildings railroad terminals and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution

he certainly  hic  does

and whats the matter with a thousand dollars
according to the budget we laid out thats more than our food bill for a whole year listen bruce i dont want walter burns to use me but im perfectly willing to use him how long will it take to get him examined
better make that a certified check walter
wait a minute bruce have you got that money
on second thought would you let me have it ill get the tickets

i know a lot of men who didnt do anything till they met walter burns please dear
ill be careful darling you be please
certified and everything got it right here in my wallet what no hes not here  im in a phone booth
fine and heres a kiss for you
i lost my wallet
yes wasnt it
im sure you havent any
oh no how could you ever think of such a thing
yes he is look bruce were taking that next train  and when i say next train this time i mean it
the criminal courts building
but gee hildy  he gave us that insurance business  and you promised 
hello bruce

well explain the whole thing to them 
bruce you know im mad about you and stop talking like that  walter
whered she go
oh  mother  she  i dont know where she went

oh yes here it is
thank you
you got it back eh theres something funny going on around here

oh
well er  it looked a little cloudy this morning
where are we going

i dont think shell need you very much  i aim to do most of the protecting myself
i know you will bruce are you going to live with your mother
thatll be nice a home with mother a real honeymoon in albany too ow
yes i know  hildy will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath she didnt even know i was in town
well albanys a mighty good insurance town most people there take it out pretty early in life
well i honestly feel that way i figure im in one line of business that really helps people of course we dont help you much when youre alive  but afterward  thats what counts
just sweeney again one of my best reporters
its simple a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down
all youve got to do is talk to him but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be reelected
how
oh  an hour for the interview another hour to write it
you havent seen anything yet
why shouldnt i make hildy my beneficiary ive got nobody else to leave it to
well youll take care of her after all if that doctors right im going to live for a long time yet look bruce this is a debt of honor i was a very bad husband hildy could have got a lot of alimony if shed wanted to but she wouldnt take any she had it coming to her but she was too independent
figure it this way i ought to be good for twentyfive years by that time youll probably have made enough so that the money wont mean anything but suppose you havent made good  dont you think hildys entitled to a quiet old age without any worries
and remember this bruce i love her too
and the beauty of it is shell never have to know till ive passed on maybe shell think kindly of me  after im gone
no bruce you didnt come between us it was all over for her before you came on the scene for me  itll never be over
certified im afraid hildyd feel ashamed to think she hadnt trusted you
thats all i ask oh wait a minute
thanks ill phone hildy right away to get that story
thanks a lot
oh sure  well thanks for everything
so long
what the devil do you want listen bruce you cant come in here now were busy  where you been duffy stick around what what chinese earthquake the deuce with it whats that

why im surprised mr burns thats no way to talk to your wife  even if shes no longer your wife
hello walter  hi louie  hows the slotmachine king
you know what how long since weve seen each other
maybe it was yesterday been seeing me in your dreams
oh yes i would id know you any time 
i notice you still remember it
you know hildy i sort of wish you hadnt done it
divorced me it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself it almost gives him a feeling he wasnt wanted
nonsense youve got the oldfashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever  till death us do part why a divorce doesnt mean anything today its only a few words mumbled over you by a judge weve got something between us nothing can change
now thats a nice thing to say
well i meant to let you go  but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry
well i dont want to brag but ive still got the dimple  and in the same place  i just acted like any husband who doesnt want to see his home broken up
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky  age sixtythree  getting food and air out of a tube you dont deny that do you
well suppose we did that isnt what i got married for whats the good of  look walter i came up here to tell you that youll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day  sending twenty telegrams  all the rest of it because im 
what
walter youre wonderful in a loathesome sort of way now would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for
i have a lunch date i just want 
no i cant
dont tell me what to do were divorced  im a free woman youre not my husband and youre not my boss and whats more youre not going to be my boss
just what i said thats what i 
thats the first time youve been right today thats what i 
you bet ive got a better offer
i know walter but i 
you wouldnt have taken me if i hadnt been dollfaced
listen walter 
well the paperll have to learn to do without me and so will you it just didnt work out walter
i wasnt satisfied i suppose i proposed to you
you  you 
whats the matter
dead
sweeney  well after all he didnt do it on purpose did he
well havent you got anybody else
no
keep away 
thats what im afraid of any time  any place  anywhere
get away svengali
listen you bumbleheaded baboon 
please will you just 
im not working for any other paper
look at this 
get married all you want to hildy but you cant quit the newspaper business
who says i cant youre a newspaper man
i know you hildy and i know what it would mean it would kill you
whered you meet this man
bermuda rich eh

he does does he how did i treat you  like a water buffalo
say sounds more like a guy i ought to marry whats his name
tomorrow tomorrow as quick as that
i wish you everything i couldnt give you hildy
too bad i couldnt see this guy first im pretty particular about whom my wife marries

thanks
how do you like that here i am being nice to you and your sweetheart and thats the thanks i get
i might have walter but you were never there
thank you
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord they cant even find him  i tell you drink is the ruin of this nation
so  sweeney gets twins  and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow
because it happened to be a colored policeman
especially with an election coming up in a few days
im an editor i know what ought to be written but i cant write it the way you could it needs a womans heart 
you see what i had to put up with she never trusted me you argue with her  otherwise youre going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands
what a performance bravo dont let him fool you bruce  its only an act
well its either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeneys
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago if hes got twins this morning i claim it was done with mirrors
were not interested
you keep out of this bruce suppose you examine mr burns in his office ill get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building you phone me as soon as mr burns has given you his check then ill go get the interview and you phone mother that were taking the six oclock train  and no tricks walter
oh nothing of course you might cancel the check yes wait a minute what would be his first payment on that policy
yes  and thats putting it mildly no certified check  no story  get me
no thanks ive still got those well ill step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn itll be kind of fun to see the boys again too remember bruce it must be certified

what happened oh im sorry its none of my business
grab mary and come inside
tickets for what
i dont want to see that
oh yeah murder museum sounds fun
fried chicken  anybody want some
that seems likely
hey listen to this i think this is related to our dr satan
yeah in this book theres a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an armless wonder
it says records show that ellie thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings until such time that she was placed in the care of the willows state mental facility
now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16
blah blah blah it doesnt say but she was released sometime in 1937 only to reappear as ellie bogdan the armless wonder says she crisscrossed the united states constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946
these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr satan working at the looney bin ill bet he amputated her arms
i dont know i just thought it was interesting
i dont  i just thought it was weird
when

i dont know dad  but it was big

i was so scared
ill take you to school
i will  but isnt that odd  about my dream

behind my house up on the ridge
i dont see anything

the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us

where
dad was onto something here

dont worry doctor schneider will be there to meet you
i maintain an apartment in venice at your disposal
id rather spit in your face but as i havent got any spit
youre meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend
dont take that tone with me my good man now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries
dear me the man is dense this is a castle isnt it there are tapestries
how dare he
i know who you are mr donovan your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive
that was our assessment as well
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper  can you translate the inscription
the holy grail doctor jones the chalice used by christ during the last supper the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea
eternal life doctor jones the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail  oh now thats a bedtime story id like to wake up to
every mans dream  including your fathers i believe
what good is it this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons pretty vague where do you start looking maybe if the tablet were intact youd have something to go on but the entire top portion is missing
ive heard this one as well two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france but only one of them made it and before dying of extreme old age he supposedly imparted his tale to a  to a franciscan friar i think
thats usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet
yes
youve got the wrong jones mister donovan why dont you try my father
didnt i warn you not to trust anybody doctor jones
as what a nazi stooge like you
shooting me wont get you anywhere
were through
yes
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for
who attila the professor he was never giddy even when he was a schoolboy
i usually dont
in that case i permit you
but im already sad  by tomorrow it will have faded
find something
you dont disappoint doctor jones youre a great deal like your father
lower me down
right six hundred years before the crusades
are you sure
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork
its a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet
he never would have made it past the rats he hates rats hes scared to death of them
what
you said go between them
mine too
the grail diary
you had it you didnt trust me
oh yes give them a flower and theyll follow you anywhere
no
its lucky i dont do things the same way youd still be standing at the venice pier
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors
dont know think of something
how do you know
so it did
where is it i want it
my father didnt want it incinerated
yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands for  who gives a damn what you think
all i have to do is scream
im like a bad penny i always turn up
its ours indy yours and mine
i can reach it i can reach it
out
then wait  count to twenty
junior
dont call me that please
i came to get you what do you think
and the head  you hit me dad
dont worry  im fine
well i am sorry about your head though but i thought you were one of them
good point
i got it and i used it we found the entrance to the catacombs

he was actually there you saw him
and his shield the inscription on sir richards shield
alexandretta of course on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire oh junior

half the german armys on our tail and you want me to go to berlin into the lions den
what about marcus
two selfless martyrs jesus christ
this is an obsession dad i never understood it never neither did mom
i dont know the first available flight out of germany
relax
thats not all we shared its disgraceful youre old enough to be her fa er her grandfather
i was the next man
hmmm what did we talk about
and do i detect a rebuke
actually i was a wonderful father
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country and i learned it so well that weve hardly spoken for twenty years
dad how can you
then what are you complaining about  look we have work to do when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges  first the breath of god only the penitent man will pass second the word of god only in the footsteps of god will he proceed third the path of god only in the leap from the lions head will he prove his worth
i dont know well find out
fly yes land no
what happens at eleven oclock
more or less  son im sorry they got us
thanks
i know dad
it happens to me all the time
this could be close
dad were well out of range

what happened to marcus sallah
come on  come on
ill take the camels
but indy 
compensation for my brotherinlaws car indy your father and brody 
they have them in the belly of that steel beast
because youre looking for the holy grail
no
if you dont let go doctor jones well both die
my soul is prepared hows yours
no doctor jones its yours
if you let me go i will tell you where he is
my name is kazim
the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe
i didnt come for the cup of christ i came to find my father
just a routine inspection tour
of course the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices the british army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of 1857
im sure that will please the maharajah captain
no but i am interested in the occult and this is a kryta
its like the voodoo dolls of west africa the kryta represents your enemy  and gives you complete power over him
you think so
this is a different situation dr jones these people are like children we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century
no hes a very shrewd old boy power behind the throne and all that he actually runs this whole province
something magical a sacred rock
even if they were trying to scare us away a devout hindu would never touch meat  makes you wonder what these people are
miss scott panicked
did you discover anything in that tunnel dr jones
finally
no  you cant go something awfuls happened theyve got short round and i think indys been 
we found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace please come with me ill show you
its some kind of cult and theyve got the sacred stones that indy was searching for
i remember first hearing your name when i was studying at oxford i am chattar lal prime minister for his highness the maharajah of pankot
you should have been there
no no that is uhmed singh the present maharajahs late father
dinner and with a prince my luck is changing but look at me  my god ive to get ready
his highness has not yet taken a wife
im afraid theyll kill them we saw horrible things down there  they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a mans heart out
whatre you talking about  im not a dope fiend i saw it ill show you
lost no were not lost were on our way to delhi this is miss scott  and mr round my names indiana jones
i am only his humble servant but the maharajah usually listens to my advice
a very fine collection of very old pieces dont you think
there are no stories anymore
maybe but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace
dr jones in our country a guest does not usually insult his host
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died they also said their children were taken from them
dr jones we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist
and didnt the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country
exactly what we have here dr jones
yes i understand
kali ma protects us now and for ever and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood
lao she
i dont like to show off
sure i found him then last night i had a little trouble somebody tried to slit my throat
next time ill cut off more than his finger
a bonus dr jones that is poison you just drank the rest of it
at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor
step on it short round
sure indy  three tickets you me and wu han 
okay shorty
its just superstition shorty like a ghost story
nope you got a little surprise over there shorty
thats it pankot palace
just a statue
you dont like him do you
no
yeah thats what happened
okay shorty see you in the morning im going to have a little  word with willie
follow in the footsteps of shiva do not betray his truth
why they glow like that
why
behind you
read you loud and clear indy
what
nobodys perfect the way i heard it you stole one of them from a small village
two are still missing
thats what youve got these children  these slaves digging for
nobody can say you dont have a vivid imagination
you are in no position to give orders dr jones
mola ram  youre about to meet kali  in hell
youre betrayed shiva 
pankot isnt on the way to delhi
hasnt the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of 1857
i dont understand whats happened here
what evil
nobody brought us here our plane crashed we were shot down by 
long ago  before my fathers father
they say we must pray to their evil god we say we will not
im sorry i dont know how i can help you here
hey hes not a waiter
who cares wheres that diamond
relax ive been giving him lessons
dont get your hopes up  wheres the antidote
poison never agrees with me  pull a right short round and head for the wang poo bridge
the airport no look out short round left left

the old man saw it in a dream
he said thats whey they were at river  they were waiting for the plane to fall down
thats more food than these people eat in a week  theyre starving too
its a sacred stone in a shine thats supposed to protect a village
their children
it was destined that i came here  and the future cannot be changed
stark naked you wish if youre trying to seduce me dr jones this is a very primitive approach
somehow i feel safer in here
dont worry im coming in what is it
a snake
uh listen  willie  i got a better idea
first of all  dont panic
its pulling me deeper
its curling around me damn it stop talking and do something

i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket
hell be okay hes a good kid
well when my nightclub career was run over by the depression some pinhead convinced me that a girl could go places in the orient so look where i got
oh thats easy  im going to latch onto a goodlooking incredibly rich prince
oh really
is that what youre hoping to find at this palace dr jones
what does the writing say
thats shiva whats he giving the priest
you mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village
id be safer sleeping with that snake
just try and control yourself
he said he couldnt take us any farther he has to go sell the elephants
yeah i wish youd thought of this sooner
she might get away with that act here but shed never make it in a real nightclub
maybe he likes older women

lowell
how long
you got a deal 
you bet we are and i cant talk to you now

well its authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented
ill take a look at what you got but im not moving any deadlines cause you say so
yeah catch you later
suein hwang and milo geyelin
okay
what do you mean whats it do
because he has to reveal it in a court of law its on record its out its no secret anymore so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate its out in the world
oh we need cops on the street we dont need them on horses
oh for gods sake what has this guy got a horse fetish
get me to new orleans this afternoon ill shoot the fucking thing myself
excuse me lowell sharons on line 3
get me wigand
fuck is this fuck
okay hold on a second what is it
good
if you are then ill take barbara to soccer and take you to dance after
maybe later
im cooking pasta primavera
yeah they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of kools to the world  sealed doesnt hurt scruggs litigation and since were the only ones with the story i believe were sitting on an exclusive
lunch
its an alternate version so what if we have an alternate version and i dont think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable
its not a rumor its a sale  if tisch can unload cbs for 81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibilliondollar lawsuit from brown  williamson that could screw up the sale could it not
oh no of course theyre not influenced by money they work for free and you are a volunteer executive producer
no im questioning your hearing you hear reasonable and tortious interference i hear potential brown  williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse i hear shut the segment down cut wigand loose obey orders and fuck off thats what i hear
i am you pay me to go get guys like wigand to draw him out to get him to trust us to get him to go on television i do i deliver him he sits he talks he violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement and hes only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue maybe the biggest mostexpensive corporatemalfeasance case in us history and jeffrey wigand whos out on a limb does he go on television and tell the truth yes is it newsworthy yes are we gonna air it of course not why because hes not telling the truth no because he is telling the truth thats why were not going to air it and the more truth he tells the worse it gets
cmon what are you and are you a businessman or are you a newsman because that happens to be what mike and i do for a living
well what do you think im going to do quit in protest im not going to do that
no im not going to take no for an answer no
end up in a highprofile lawsuit with lowell the first amendment martyr i dont think so  take a look at this this is a summary of a dossier thats being prepared
what does it look like im doing im editing
no i should have i told them i disagreed with you mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original im not lying for you im not gonna shut up for you not on any of it
no you fucked you dont invert stuff big tobacco tried to smear wigand you bought it the wall street journal here not exactly a bastion of anticapitalist sentiment refutes big tobaccos smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination and now even now when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi the cat totally out of the bag youre still standing here debating don what the hell else do you need
so what happened to ms caperellis checking with outside counsel first all that crap
im not touching my film
no im not
before you go
im not implying im quoting more vested interests  persons who will profit from this merger  ms helen caperelli general counsel of cbs news 39 million mr eric kluster president of cbs news 14 million
yes im afraid i did
what caliber is your gun
yes sir what caliber is your gun
if we could take a look mr wigand
yes i do a 38 target master in my gun safe downstairs a 45 gold cup a 22 target pistol so what
yes yes i do  yes i get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox
we have a search warrant mr wigand theres been a death threat
you alright mr wigand
hey lowell
what about you you got a crew already
okay 
no no were fine
how grave
mike
im told unusual promises were made to wigand
and im told there are questions as to our star witness veracity
our standards have to be higher than anyone elses because we are the standard for everyone else
well with tortious interference im afraid the greater the truth the greater the damage
they own the information hes disclosing the truer it is the greater the damage to them if he lied he didnt disclose their information and the damages are smaller
youre getting ahead of yourself were all in this together were all cbs well find out soon thank you gentlemen
how are you jim
catch you later

alright what did you think
no i usually sit around in my hotel room dressed like this at 530 in the morning sleepy look on my face
oh lots
but in all that time mike did you ever get off a plane walk into a room and find that a source for a story changed his mind lost his heart walked out on us not one fucking time you want to know why
im going to tell you why because when i tell someone im going to do something i deliver
oh please mike
no you give me a break i never left a source hung out to dry ever abandoned not til right fucking now when i came on this job i came with my word intact im gonna leave with my word intact fuck the rules of the game hell youre supposed to know me mike what the hell did you expect you expect me to lie down back off what get over it
like what corporate responsibility what are we talking celebrity here
you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years
everything interests me
i did what do i tell a source on the next tough story hang in with us youll be fine maybe
yeah thank you
what ive seen ive liked
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now so you care about what youre thought of in america and in america at this moment in time hezbollah does not have a face  thats why
no we dont do that  youve seen 60 minutes and mike wallace so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity you also know we are the highestrated mostrespected tvmagazine news show in america
thats good that works  uh you know i want to ask you something i know it sounds odd but
thats room service they usually knock first  come on in over here please
black black
is there anything you want to know about me mr wigand
just so i know you know when i talk to people in confidence it stays that way
far as you go where
between journalists and management yes i believe they do but i dont take that seriously  where do you work
did work
that you have to discuss with cbs business affairs but for something like this i would say anywhere between 10 12 thousand
if you want to do it
what are you talking about where are you
jump in quick cmon
good i want to talk to you
i did not burn you i did not give you up to anyone
to straighten something out with you right here right now
why am i gonna mention your name
how the hell do i know about brown  williamson
and i dont like paranoid accusations im a journalist think use your head how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it
no i did not big tobacco is a big story and you got something important to say i can tell  but yes i did i came all the way down here to tell you story no story fuck your story i dont burn people
theyre afraid of you arent they
like what
johnson  johnson union carbide in japan i was general manager and director of new products i speak japanese i was a director of corporate development at pfizer all healthrelated  what else outside the zone
the seven ceos of big tobacco they got up in front of congress that time it was on television
it was on cspan yeah
i cant talk about it the work i was supposed to do might have had some positive effect i dont know it could have been beneficial  mostly i got paid a lot i took the money my wife was happy my kids had good medical good schools got a great house  i mean what the hell is wrong with that
then youre in a state of conflict jeff
you okay
good  you have kids
oh yes yes yes i did i wanted to talk to you i wanted to hook up and talk to you about what we were talking about in your car
makes you feel good putting what you know to use
its obvious isnt it
yeah look thanks for talking im sorry i woke you up
tempura
marcuse yeah he was my mentor he had a major influence on the new left in the late 60s and on me personally
my father what the hells that got to do with my father
you charge by the hour
well my father left us when i was fiveyears old he was not the most ingenious man i ever knew lets get back to brown  williamson if you decide to go on 60 minutes i got to know everything about why you got fired
theyre gonna dig up stuff from your past theyre gonna throw it at you i got to know what theyre gonna throw you understand
im not pushing you around  im asking you questions
to a network probably were all commodities  to me you are not a commodity what you are is important
no
you believe that
you believe that because you get information out to people something happens
maybe thats just what youve been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job having status and maybe for the audience its just voyeurism something to do on a sunday night and maybe it wont change a fucking thing and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry used up broke alone
i dont think you really understand 
i have to put my familys welfare on the line here my friend and what are you puttin up youre puttin up words
theyre terrorizing us death threats to my family my kids
they do this with impunity
they get to go home at night what does it cost these people to do this to us nothing my girls are crying so fuck them i want to tape im done thinking about it
ill call them lowell
to talk about it to think about it i had a plan to ease her into it but i really  i didnt know how to do that
they volunteered a friend owns a large security company
i heard
i know im going to go there tonight
yeah great
i dont know what to do
you mean since this morning
run that sandefur piece on nicotines not addictive run that oncamera then cut right to wigand with i believe they perjured then go wide to the ceos all taking the oath back on jeff and play the pause after the word felt on the bside
what
no
i do not think that you know for me what it is to walk in my shoes  for my kids to have seen it for them to know why ive put them through what i did the public airing of that the testament to why i did what i did youre telling me is not going to see the light of day
what do you want to do lowell look up my ass too
everything you say and i cant defend you man with one hand tied behind my back because you keep from me what they can discover and they will discover everything believe me
she sued you for back payments of child support
what
what kind of shit is this i was not on the team i sparred with the olympic team okay
abc
a can opener a 3995 can opener i canceled payment it was junk  you ever bounce a check lowell you ever look at another womans tits you ever cheat a little on your taxes  whose life if you look at it under a microscope doesnt have any flaws
what does this have to do with my testimony
what does this have to do with my testimony i told the truth its valid and true and provable
i told the truth i told the truth
and ive got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before the wall street journal runs  i am trying to protect you man
thats bullshit jeff
i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes i helped him to say yes alright youre not a robot jeff thats all you got a mind of your own dont you
i fought for you and i still fight for you
jeffrey where you going with this so where you goin  you are important to a lot of people jeffrey you think about that you think about them
im on a leave of absence forced vacation
yeah yeah i will
no no dont call the police  just tell him im on the phone with you my name is lowell bergman just tell him that
youre breaking up i cant hear you
what
he doesnt seem to be listening
i cant say that
for example james burke the ceo of johnson  johnson when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in tylenol bottles he didnt argue with the fda he didnt even wait for the fda to tell him he just pulled tylenol off every shelf of every store right across america instantly and then he developed the safety cap because look as a ceo sure hes gotta be a great businessman right but hes also a man of science hes not going to allow his company to put on the shelf a product that might hurt people  not like the seven dwarfs
shes okay
what do you mean followed you did you call the police
well what do you really think though
you called me
someone put a bullet in my mailbox
then hold it off the air until you got that but i want to go to new york and i want to go on the record right now
there is  there is no family
liane has filed for divorce
where you staying now
good to meet you dr wigand
right
dr wigand you do understand what could happen dont you
i believe mr sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully
part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated at least within brown  williamsons representation clearly misstated what is common language within the company we are in the nicotine delivery business
a delivery device for nicotine
youre gonna get your fix
the process is known as impact boosting while not spiking nicotine they clearly manipulate it theres extensive use of this technology know as ammonia chemistry it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system
and you sent the document forward to sandefur
in other words you were charging sandefur and brown  williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously
and on march 24 thomas sandefur ceo of brown  williamson had you fired and the reason he gave you
and do you wish you hadnt come forward you wish you hadnt blown the whistle
the former executive has reason to bet on being sued for major cigarette manufacturers
there are times i wish i hadnt done it but there are times that i feel compelled to do it ive  if you asked me if i would do it again or if its  do i think its worth it yeah i think its worth it
it acts as a drug on the body
it acts as a
there an echo in here your objections been recorded she typed it into her little machine over there its on the record so now ill proceed with my deposition of my witness does it act as a drug
oh you got rights and lefts ups and downs and middles so what you dont get to instruct anything around here this is not north carolina not south carolina nor kentucky this is the sovereign state of mississippis proceeding wipe that smirk off your face dr wigands deposition will be part of this record and im going to take my witness testimony whether the hell you like it or not  answer the question dr
mr scruggs jeff wigand lowell bergman said i should give you a call
when should we do this
possibly yes that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today thats right
seven
id rather play than talk about it  what did you want to see me about i dont like being back here
chapter and verse
we worked together for what was it three years now the work we did here is confidential not for public scrutiny any more than are ones family matters
now dont be paranoid jeff  about the direction of research here we may have had our differences of opinion
thats why we hire scientists
i appreciate all that jeff but upon reflection weve decided to expand our zone of comfort with you
well i wouldnt say 
he 
they hate each other 
i told you we know each other baby mr massey represented my exbrother in law martin reiser
miles i know youre busy and that you charge by the hour so ill come to the point howard and i are planning to marry

meaning my house
did our marriage ever mean anything to you
thats blackmail
marylin
you have to leave the house immediately
no buts now out
please leave the house
so did i now pack up a few basics and 
marylin
now but first he worked for you
wait just a second there you sent him here you unearthed this pestilence
thats true
im not leaving you i took self defense
hello miles
its not something i wanted either
yes i know its exactly how i felt when i realized youd hired the goon to kill
your forgetting rex rexroth
forgery fraud
murder
i dont see how we can ever find our way back from
fine they were created during a dictatorship  what if something happened to you what would i tell little gus when he asked what was my daddy like
i thought so
look marylin cant we have a civilized discussion about this
but marylin you know a divorce would ruin me right now everything i have  everything we have  is tied up in my business the business is my entire life

like i know his intention or yours for that matter  i should join sam im too old for this bullshit
he was right wasnt he
now well marylin now you cut a deal or find out how jean harris made it work for her
i didnt know barry had a beach house

of massey myerson
by reputation he got ann rumsey that cute little island of georges
now shes a night manager at mcdonalds
we do have a man for you
i wish i had your discipline
well what does he want
he has a reputation for being tough
oh god
im dying
so where are you now
shit
they bought her speech if i was only in it for rexs money he shouldnt have to give me any
so marylin is that what you said when you were a little girl
no ill see some blood before this is over but it wont be mine
hello miles
i want to be exposed
its not ming its tong
what about rugs i thought we were stopping at mansour
hes not what i expected hes very  hes so  happy
yes yes its just  you know ive never been the first wife rex was married before me
miles is different hes still so idealistic
he has no cynicism or anger for once im not the repository of rage at some other woman
i guess
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs he had a device he called the intruder
yes
excuse me
he tricked you with a phony wife and a fake prenup howard doyle he got you you married marylin didnt you you thought she had money ha ha ha howard doyle made you think that because of what you did to me and to marylin rexroth yeah i heard all about it my brother howard doyle got you  neener neener neener
when you have a moment
please no calls im feeling very fragile
marylin rexroth when does she 
sam is sam hes taking up fly fishing hes in a yert in montana
oh just a routine mammogram she said to say hello shes going to positano with your brothers family
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
heh heh
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
oh brother here we go
yes maybe youre right miles maybe were being too conservative seventy five percent
kirshner does not apply kirshner was in kentucky
rephrase mrs rexroth have you ever been in love
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle they dont like the way you operate they helped her
i have no idea what howard doyle eats im not a damn dietician
shes your wife why dont you ask her anyway i assume she signed the highly over rated massey prenup
dont give me that crap thats my crap
ill have you suspended ill have you disbarred
why did she do it ruth why
weve outlined a settlement
rex please
thank you
thats her job you have to respect that
mm
no not exactly it didnt exactly cool marylin is a knockout and very sexy  but  theres a lot of it out there
you know what i mean when i say it
seems like theres more of it than ever before 
i dont know i can assume

what
id stay away from her miles
miles
the plastic surgeon i read about you in la style
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well 
 the coin
should we counsel fear  or trust should we seek to destroy  or to build should we meet our clients problems with cynicism  or with love
we dont have much of a relationship anymore i havent seen her since before she married rex we had some very nice times prior to that we were quite close
mother
hard to believe i know im sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters
you were never invited to meet your soninlaw
of course of course she was married what else would she be single i dont think so
whos patty

im worried lovington after all something might have happened to her 
yes sir
whyuhshes all right sir
oh no sir no different than
yes sir if youll excuse me sirshe sent me for a drink  andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs following which the scene dissolves to the upstairs corridor in front of ellies door andrews enters and knocks several times receiving no response he gingerly opens the door
i found a million dollar baby
you neednt see anybody you can come directly to my study id appreciate it very much if

thats typical of your daughter takes those things for granted  why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami  for the love of it

if i didnt i wouldnt be here  ive got it all itemized 
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents
yes i knowbut
let me get this straight you want this thirtynine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars
the reward
im afraid im a little confused you see i assumed you were coming here for
youre a peculiar chap
the average man would go after the reward all you seem to
you were taken for a buggy ride
a guy thatd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined
she grabbed herself a perfect running mate king westley the pill of the century  what she needs is a guy thatd take a sock at her every daywhether its coming to her or not
do you love her
i asked you a question do you love her
i dont want to eat  and theres one more thing i dont want definitely thats to see you
why dont you put me in chains
all right put me in chains do anything you want  but im not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat
i wont stand for it i wont stand for your running my life why do you insist on it
yes i know  because im your daughter and you love me because you dont want me to make any mistakes because
youre wasting your time im already married to him
if gandhi had a chef like paul it would change the whole political situation in india

youre going to finance him i suppose
hes no good ellie and you know it you married him only because i told you not to
i wont thank you ill never thank you
ill shout to my hearts content ill scream if i want to
oh hello dad

on the road

i dont know very much about him  except that i love him
itll do no good  he despises me
he despises everything i stand for he thinks im spoiled and pampered and selfish and thoroughly insincere
he doesnt think so much of you either
he blames you for everything thats wrong about me thinks you raised me stupidly
hes marvelous
i dont know
its no use dad i practically threw myself at him 
no ill go through with it
it doesnt matter  i dont want to stir up any more trouble ive been doing it all my life ive been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine too im tired dad tired of running around in circles hes right thats what ive been doing ever since i can remember

of course i mean it i dont care whom shes married to  as long as i can get her back 
she hasnt had a thing yesterdayor today
yessir she refuses them all
its not quite that simple  ive dealt with prisoners in my time but this one
lower the boats
terrible nothing terrible about her shes great marvelous youngster got a mind of her own knows just what she wants  shes not going to get it though she wont get very far has no money
holy smoke i forgot all about that  send a wireless at once lovington detective agency daughter escaped again watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in miami have your new york office keep tabs on king westley intercept all messages want her back at all costs
youve made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment  well it hasnt bothered me for a minute ellie and i got married because we love each other and shes proving it as far as im concerned theres going to be no annulment
naturally  youre going to become a partner in a big institution its one of the largest in the world
someday perhaps you might even take charge
no  say listenive devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat toughest job i ever tackled ever hear of jp clarkson biggest man in the country isnt he well i tamed him  got him eating out of the palm of my hand ive browbeaten financiers statesmen foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut ive never been able to do a thing with her shes been too much for me im glad you think its easy  now listenif youll do what i tell you perhaps i might develop a little respect for you you never can tell

al you cant tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close  goddamn sam  if we dont start reading between the lines here yall gotta start thinking on a different level  like the cia does were through the looking glass here white is black and black is white
the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist  they got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture doesnt even match  im beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castros door  if oswald or someone purporting to be oswald had gotten into cuba come back then killed the president the american public once again wouldve screamed for a cuban invasion
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating and well end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks  if we call him now he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot weve ever had
when youre in a war boss you use every weapon you got
well what do you expect from a pig but a grunt
threat to assassinate president kennedy in dallas texas november 2223  information received by the bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate president kennedy on his proposed trip to dallas texas etc etc
ive seen him copying files leaving here late at night
because you keep conning me dean i read your testimony to the warren commission and
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this clay bertrand and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswalds layer
now thats pretty important dean you also told the fbi when you met him he was six foot two  then you tell the commission he was five foot eight  how the hell did the man shrink like that dean
you cant ever say crime dont pay in louisiana jim  only not as good as it used to  good chowder aint it
oh i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in 56 57 when i lived down in the quarter
swishes  they swish yknow  young fags you know  theyd come into my bureau needing help no bread and id say hey man i aint rockefeller who gonna back you up  these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial
you knew you werent talking to some low life fag you know  he had command of the kings english
always  like tits on a pig  i wish i had a million of those bimbettes
like i told to the washington boys bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge
three four  he came in with a few cubano swishes one time i remember
mario jose  they wear names like you and i wear clothes  today the name is candy tomorrow its butsie i wish i could help you jim
hell no  i told this bertrand cat right off this isnt my scene man i deal with muni court im a hack in nigger town that kid needs a hot dog
there were no phone records
i dont know how they got to me maybe cause i repped him here  the feebees run background checks  on my mamas breasts man thats all i got  there wasnt no conspiracy jim  if there were why the hell didnt bobby kennedy prosecute it as attorney general he was his brother for chrissake  how the fuck three people could keep a secret like that i dont know  it was oswald  he was a nut job  faggot yknow hated this country
gods sake chief  the president was shot
chief maybe you had a little too much to drink
i think ill cut out here chief  i gotta get home
chief sometimes i dont know whether youre kidding or not
you may not like this chief but youre beginning to act paranoid  i mean you really are
goddammit chief why would i ever need to look in your files  i saw enough here this summer to write a book
you know what i mean  i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer  and a lotta strange people
yes but were talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance  three years later and hes still classified  they gave us his grammar school records a study of his pubic hairs put it in context bill of what we know about oswald  lonely kid no father unstable childhood high school dropout  wants to grow up and be a spy joins the marines at 17  he learns russian he acts overtly marxist with two other marines but hes stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate  hes discharged from the marines supposedly because his mothers sick  he stays home 3 days then with a 1500 ticket from a 203 bank account he goes to moscow
susie youre an assistant da remember  stick to what you can prove in court
grab your socks and pull clay bertrand is clay shaw
maybe i have a little more respect for this countrys institutions than you do susie  you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob the cia fbi and army intelligence and who knows what else when you know you cant even keep a secret in this room between 12 people  we got leaks everywhere were going to trial here  what the hell do we really got  oswald ruby banister ferrie are dead  shaw  maybe hes an agent i dont know but as a covert operator in my book hes wide open for blackmail cause of his homosexuality
hey where yat frank  youre wasting your time here  big jim gave strict orders  no fbi allowed
boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew 
yeah i guess you do
frank i dont want to hear it
no im not
pretty fast wasnt it  the way they let him go
im just an investigator bill  i leave the theories to you lawyers
pretty flowery for dave ferrie
not unless we go for shaw now
rumor is shaw a local boy was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement  no one really knows what they were doing there but everyone sure saw em they stood out like cottonballs  i got whites and blacks saw em but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote we still got the negro junkie vernon bundy saw em talkin at the seawall near lake pontchartrain  but its tough boss  no one wants to talk about shaw  hes
keep saying what
who is he joe  ive been to every bar no one wants to talk
whats the other name
clay bertrand is clay shaw  the guy who used to run the international trade mart
so why does he call himself bertrand
yeah  clay  i met him sometime in june of 62 at the masquerade bar dave ferrie took me there for the express reason to meet him
twenty dollars each time  hell its no secret  thats what im here for
and thats where you met oswald for the first time
go on willie
the anonymous kind chief
at 730 sunday morning  its not exactly fresh blood were sniffing here boss
yever heard of a double agent bill im beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist after the arrest 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again  now heres another one for you  what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine
no youre awake bill and im dead serious  and were going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago  how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day
does that bother you bill  i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute she has to have bad eyesight
when somethings rotten in the land bill it generally isnt just one fish well get corroboration find this clay bertrand  if i were a betting man id give you 10 to 1 its an alias  start checking around the quarter
the murder of a president bill is a crime in orleans parish too  i didnt pick you because of your legal skill you know
were saying that when oswald went to russia he was not a real defector that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died thats what were saying
ill go you one better  maybe oswald didnt even pull the trigger bill the nitrate test indicates he didnt even fire a rifle on november 22nd and on top of that they didnt even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day
it went to the goddamn fbi and they didnt find a goddamn thing  it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he couldve taken off oswald at the morgue  theres no chain of evidence bill  and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository  one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser described by deputy weitzman maybe just maybe lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill  a patsy  take it at face value  lou susie im going with my gut here  hes got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle oh lee to rent the room right  whats in a name right  in intelligence theyre assumed to be fake  a name is sort of like a postbox number a code  several different people can use the same name right  then why cant somebody be using oswalds name
to frame him obviously  you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think bill  theyre not ordinary crooks
lets start making some assumptions about the man  why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswalds this is not a thin trail gentlemen it is a very wide one  who found the evidence  who set him up  lou bill susie i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of 63  see if its the same guy
thats gonna be tough  nobodys talking
oh jesus stoner why doesnt he call me
well they offered you the carrot and you turned it down you know whats coming next dont you boss
jesus they mustve been hard pressed to come up with that one
where you going boss
theres a word  orders
so for those reasons youre going to trial against clay shaw chief well youre gonna lose  we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans  carlos marcello santos trafficante  i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government  rubys all mob knows oswald sets him up  hoffa  trafficante  marcello they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government doesnt want to open up a whole can oworms there because it used the mob to get to castro  yknow castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q  citizen  so they close the book on jfk  it makes sense to me
oh now youre saying lyndon johnson was involved  the president of the united states
boss are you calling the president a murderer
maybe cause theres some rogue element in the government
yeah
this is louisiana chief  how the hell do you know who your daddy is cause your momma told you so youre way out there taking a crap in the wind boss and i for one aint going along on this one  jim sighs saddened  bill was one of his best men
i dont see any violence jim  heart attack maybe an aneurysm  looks like natural causes
hed die pretty quick either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain
not in a routine autopsy but if we looked at the spinal fluid there might be a high level of iodine but its difficult to know  whatcha thinkin jim
if its a suicide i seen weirder jim 
i did
well i wanted to make sure shes the same girl i sent
well you see ive been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948 when i was in korea
no i did not
no i did not
no i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures ive been shown
no i did not
dave
dave do you think were out of our minds  the whole buildings been a zoo since that broke  we cant get a thing done  reporters crawling everywhere  you think we want that

listen dave why dont we order some room service have a bite relax ill stay as long as you want
i dont have much time  they dont even need bugs anymore  they got these fuckin satellite waves  they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born right up his nostrils subcutaneous between his eyes  he was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment  a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother  youd never believe half the shit the agency does  im so fuckin tired  havent slept since that shit article came out whyd you guys have to go and get me involved with this
that cocksuckin faggot  hes got me by the balls
photographs  compromising stuff and hell use em  the agency plays for keeps  i knew oswald  he was in my civil air patrol unit  i taught him everything  a wanna be yknow nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch  i treated him good  hed talk about his kid yknow really wanted her to grow up with a chance but he got a raw deal  the agency fucked him  just like theyre gonna fuck me
theyre agency too  dont you get it  cia and mafia together  trying to whack out the beard  mutual interests  they been doing it for years  theres more to this than you dream  fbi fucking hates the cia  navy intelligence got something to do with it too  check out alan pope in miami  jack youngblood bill harvey  colonel roselli  the shooter i hear was a dallas cop  the bagman at rubys club  i heard he shot his own partner  got that check out the rich fucks in dallas hl hunt  hes dirty  thats all i know  but the agency always runs the show  check out something called mongoose  operation mongoose government pentagon stuff theyre in charge but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows fun n games man  check out southeast asia  thats the next big number  the heroin trail  oh what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive
do you remember me mr garrison  i met you on carondolet street right after your election  i congratulated you remember
how could i  dave as you know president kennedy was assassinated on friday  a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby  weve heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and weve been advised you knew oswald pretty well
but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager
im sure youve seen this  perhaps you knew this man under another name
well that mustve been mistaken information we got  thanks for straightening it out for us  there is one other matter thats come up dave  we were told you took a trip to texas shortly after the assassination of friday
what was so appealing about houston
dave may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory
i see  and where did you drive
why galveston
and then sunday
did you bag any geese on this trip
but the boys told us they didnt get any
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car  dave isnt it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun
i see  dave thank you for your time  im sorry it has to end inconveniently for you but im going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi
dave i find your story simply not believable
would you say this leon was actually lee harvey oswald
oh you got that  banisters pet project  getting paid by the government to work against the government  beautiful  what a mind he had what a guy guy  he had all those files
you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination dont you
everybody  the agency  the mob the cubans  yeah follow the cubans check them out  here in dallas miami  check out a guy named eladio del valle  my paymaster when i flew missions into cuba  hes somewhere in miami  youre on the right track
fuckin a  how do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit  fuck knows what they got on oswald
same one  i didnt know no impersonator
black black  just give it to me  shit  im so exhausted  my neck is killing me  ive got cancer  had it for years  i been working with mice yknow trying to come up with a cure
you make it sound like some remote fuckin experience in ancient history man you never leave the agency once they got you youre in for life
shaws an untouchable man  highest clearance  shaw oswald the cubans  all agency
jack  jack was a pimp  a bagman in dallas for the mob  he used to run guns to castro when he was still on our side  check out jack youngblood shit  we almost had castro  then we tried to whack him  everybodys flipping sides all the time  its fun n games man fun n games
oh man why dont you stop  this is too fuckin big for you  who did kennedy  its a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma  even the shooters dont fuckin know  dont you get it yet  i cant be talking like this  theyre gonna kill me im gonna die  i dont know what happened  all i wanted in the world was to be a catholic priest  live in a monastery study ancient latin manuscripts pray serve god  but i had this one terrible fatal weakness  they defrocked me  and then i started to lose everything
dave its going to be okay  just talk to us on the record and well protect you  i guarantee it
get some rest dave and youll feel better in the morning  well talk then
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head
i had the cause of death
well i heard dr humes stating that  he said
but you were a qualified pathologist was this army general a qualified pathologist
but you took his orders  he was directing the autopsy
there were admirals
what
i callem as i seeem jim  im ruling it inadmissible
if thats your case you didnt have a case  i wouldnt believe whatever habighorst said anyway
well i am saying it  bring in the jury
sure it is  freckle face if i ever handled a minor felon like that itd be all over the papers  id catch hell  and this is the alleged murderer of the president
thats something jasper  what is it
hi freckle face
well it looks like it jasper
no jasper nobodys gonna kill us
theres nothing wrong with feeling a little scared jasper virginia telling the truth can be a scary thing  it scared president kennedy but he was a brave man  if you let yourself be too scared then you let the bad guys take over the country dont you  and then everybody gets scared
well if they can kill the president they can certainly get me
no you dont
look do you want the truth or just what you want me to say
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots  im not going to lie for you
no  i had guns all my life  i used to go turtle shooting
so off the record he starts talking about my family and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i didnt know it or something  he got angrier and angrier and then
i knew something was crooked as a dogs hind leg cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry sure enough when i finally read my testimony as published by the warren commission it was a fabrication from start to finish
how many shots you say you heard
thats impossible  you heard echoes echoes  we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and thats all were willing to say
no i saw a guy shooting from over there  he was behind that fence what are you going to do about it
i was scared  it was all kinda queer but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three and then they took marys five snapshots from me sent them to washington and when they returned them weeks later two of them had the backgrounds mutilated the only one we saved was in marys camera  i didnt want to go to washington when the warren commission subpoenaed me so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at parkland hospital
negative on his tax records classified  first time i know a da cant get a tax record  i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them  there are about 1200 documents  oswald in the ussr in mexico city oswald and the u2 a cia 201 personnel file a memo from the director on oswald travel and activities  cant get one of them  all classified as secret on the grounds of national security  its real strange
makes sense  hes a spokesman
none  the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel  hes never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or as far as we know debriefed by the cia
the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type
and marina  does she have a problem getting out
dammit it doesnt add up  ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations  the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswalds return  only intelligence people can come and go like that
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washingtons cabinet
presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at 125 an hour
i wonder about the williams  just where did the first description of oswald come from at 1244  no one knows  they claimed it was brennans but his description came after 1 pm  who called  somehow the fbis been tapping the williams and picks up a call between bell helicopter and janets phone an unidentified voice saying we both know whos responsible  who called  whys the bureau been tapping them
goddamn  they put oswald together from day one  like some dummy corporation in the bahamas  you just move him around a board  sent him to russia in and out no passport problems  you got the word microdots in his notebook you got the minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions the sealed diz201 personnel file for all we know there could be a dozen oswalds in different cities countries  all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination  does the real oswald know hes been put together  who knows  it doesnt matter does it  hes a low level spy he doesnt know who he really works for
bugging the district attorneys office of new orleans  its outrageous
this is interesting  are you ready for this  oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination  it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald
no i dont think i am susie  anyone else
i know
well in an investigation were conducting your name has come up a number of times
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you  are you acquainted with a david logan
a perry russo
a willie okeefe
mr okeefe told us he met you at the masquerade bar down in the quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on dauphine street  do you recall that
not at all  but on the other hand i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other  that is precisely the point of a long dining table  the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it
it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then  i call him smedley  his real name is frankie jenkins  but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering frankie  where is this leading to mr garrison
pffft  absolute nonsense  the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations my dear mr garrison  grimy young hoodlums wholl say and do anything  as you well know
david ferrie
and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours
no  im sure ive never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance
clay bertrand  clay bertrand  i believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the chamber of commerce  is that the man you had in mind
one meets so many attorneys in my business  no i dont believe i know dean andrews
naturally  are you claiming mr garrison that mr oswald also had dinner with me
you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters dont you mr garrison
of course not  such a pity that assassination  in fact i admired president kennedy  a man with true panache and a wife with impeccable taste
im well aware of this asinine article  and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper
nonsense  what next
mr garrison youre reaching  i am an international businessman  the trade mart which i founded is americas commercial pipeline to latin america  i trade everywhere i am accused as are all businessmen of all things  i somehow go about my business make money help society the best i can and try to promote free trade in this world
no people like you dont have to i guess  people like you walk between the raindrops
ive spent half my life in the united states military serving and defending this great country mr shaw and youre the first person i ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president
yes it was about 11 in the morning i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass in a rented car  a blue valiant  ill never forget that day
thats right  when i saw him on tv i was shocked  i said to my family that was the man i saw in the truck
thats what bothers me mr garrison you see theyve been altered  my statements
mrs mercer as a former fbi man its difficult to accept this
mmmmm sure smells good but egghead do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination with no lawyer present and nobody recorded a word of it  i cant believe it  a police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court
well maybe youre right jim  ill give you one hour to solve the case until the kids are in bed  then youre mine and mr kennedy can wait til morning  come on everybody say goodnight to daddy
oh she did huh  when i come up ill show you how saturday night got invented
its incredible honey  the whole thing  a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union  a russian exam
honey in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test  oswald was a radar operator  hed have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas
and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing  oswald did badly on the test he says  he only had two more russian words right than wrong  ha  thats like me saying touchdown here  is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess
liz do i have to spell it out for you  lee oswald was no ordinary soldier  that was no accident he was in russia  he was probably in military intelligence  thats why he was trained in russian
goddammit  i been sleeping for three years
itll be off the record honey ill bring him in on a sunday  a quiet little chat between gentlemen
you know i dont like these tribal rituals freckle face  im interviewing clay shaw this morning
but why in the lords name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were
look at the calendar for christs sake  you said a sunday not easter sunday
youre missing most of your life jim and you dont even know it the kids are missing out too  its not just you making the sacrifice here honey
tough day
liz im really sorry  the meeting went much longer than expected
i dont know what to say except im sorry  i just dont have rabbits on my mind
i dont know what to tell them  how bout the truth  im doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice wont be an arcane vanished idea they read about in history books like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis
its going to get worse honey
its not funny jim im scared
leave us alone for gods sake  oh its lou

im not fighting you jim im just trying to reach you  youve changed
i dont want to see goddammit  im tired  ive had enough  they say you dont have anything anyway everybody in towns talking  youre ruining this man shaws life  youre attacking him because hes homosexual going ahead with this stupid trial did you ever once stop and consider what hes going through
oh i dont know anymore  i believe there was a conspiracy but not the government  i just want to raise our children and live a normal life i want my life back
you never talked to me this way before jim garrison  im not making any threats  im leaving you  im taking the kids to my mothers  i am  i am
i never doubted for a second that i was  will you come to the trial elizabeth
huh
oh no  no  i cant believe it  i cant believe it  both of them both brothers oh my god
call me willie  i aint got nuthin but time mr garrison  minutes hours days years ofem  time just stands still here like a snake sunnin itself in the road
well yeah
i remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg  he limped dont get me wrong hes not one of those you know limp wrists  hes a butch john  youd meet him on the street youd never snap  you could go fishing with him play poker with him youd never snap in a million years  so one night we were over at ferries place  having a party sometime in the late summer of 63
fuck yeah  i told you so  and you can tellem all i told you so
bring on all the motherfuckers bring their college degrees in here i got nuthin to hide  they cant buy me  you cant buy me  i dont even need the parole  this is about the truth coming out  youre a goddamn liberal mr garrison you dont know shit cause you never been fucked in the ass  fascism is here now facism is
you wanna know why  cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin election thats why  nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents til kennedy wrecked this fuckin country  got niggers all over the fuckin place asking for their rights where do you think we got all this fuckin crime now cause kennedy promised em too damned much revolution comin  fascisms coming back  i tell ya this  the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country  i jes hate to think theyre blaming it on some silly fuckin oswald who didnt know shit anyway  people should know why that sumbitch was killed  cause he was a communist  put me on the stand go ahead ill tell the same goddamn story im proud of it dont matter fuck all to me things dont change
boss the presidents been shot  in dallas  five minutes ago
no word yet  but they think its in the head
lets get outta here lou  i saw too much stuff like this in the war
hes been in trouble before  used to be a hot shot pilot for eastern airlines but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14year old boy
yeah guy banister  exfbi man  he died couple years ago
lou you were in the marines  who would be running that training
take a look across the street
upstairs  in 1963 that was the office of naval intelligence  and just by coincidence banister before he was fbi was oni  what do they say
what are you driving at boss
i cant say that comes as a surprise anymore
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes  these two look pretty young
we need to find more witnesses lou
graveyard dead near big sandy texas in 65  two in the morning on some highway  a hit and run
unless he or someone else wants him to get caught  maybe he never ordered the weapon lou  somebody else did it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswalds time sheet shows him clocked in at his job  lou come alive  these things are not adding up
i know you do lou  im doing three more lectures this month  youre all doing an incredible job sue al numa  but this is one where if you dont nail the other guy youre dead  how did jack ruby dies so quick  of what  cancer right  a history of nazi germany lou  they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30s  we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis  read this our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick maryland  close to where the national cancer institute is located  think about it  think the unthinkable  question everything
and it aint pretty  the ad has spent more than 8000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november 1966
i have a plane to catch going to washington  an interesting lead says hes closely connected to these events but he wont come down here i know what youre going through with ferrie lou  well talk tomorrow
id say the opposite  hypertension
between six and seven seconds
didnt hoover say something about that  the leaves had fallen off in november
the zapruder film is the proof they didnt count on lou  we gotta get our hands on it
why not just shoot kennedy coming up houston  theres plenty of time  hes out in the open  a frontal shot
how many men
beats me  city officials  secret service  dallas police  they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before  but they didnt bother running through dealey  they stopped right there said something like and afterwards theres only the freeway and went home
no
who
the warren commission call him
allen dulles
theyre gonna love you chief
you never got anyone killed boss their actions killed them years before  if we stopped now itd be even more wrong
we need him back
maybe you didnt hear what i said i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff i warn you that
well if thats what you want to call it  i didnt ever think it would come to this  i guess i am boss
you sure got it  youre one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch da and youre making one hell of a mistake
i sometimes feel thingsve gone downhill since john kennedy was killed senator
sure three experts and not one of them could do it  theyre telling us oswald got off three shots with worldclass precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds  and accordin to his marine buddies he got maggies drawers  he wasnt any good  average man would be lucky to get two shots off and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best  here the third shots perfect  dont make sense  and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times one pristine bullet  that dog dont hunt
if i were investigatin id round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in dallas that day  you been duck hunting  i think oswald was a good oldfashioned decoy  whatd he say  im just a patsy  out of the mouth of babes yask me
russell honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire  i just cant believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that wasnt true
ive been called everything under the sun jerry  call me whatever you like
your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching jerry  it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over  but seriously jerry people arent interested in jim garrison  they want the hard evidence  they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to
well if i am why is the government concealing evidence
thats exactly my question jerry maybe id better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what i am talking about
sure they do  the camera can pick this up
yes
well i just hope it was worth my while mr
ive already been warned by the agency mr whoever  if this is another type of threat i dont
kings are killed mr garrison politics is power nothing more but dont believe me  dont trust me  do your own work your own thinking
no chance in hell mr garrison id be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized maybe worse  you too  i can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things keep digging  yknow youre the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy  thats important  its historic
but you dont have a choice anymore youve become a significant threat to the national security structure they wouldve killed you already but you got a lot of light on you instead theyre gonna destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town  youre some kinda egocrazed southern caricature to many folks  be honest  the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm you gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack  remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba i hope you get a break
you didnt get that break you needed but you went as far as any man could bubba  what can i do for you
i think it started in the wind money  arms big oil pentagon people contractors bankers politicians like lbj were committed to a war in southeast asia  as early as 61 they knew kennedy was going to change things he was not going to war in southeast asia  who knows probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere  houston new york  hell maybe bonn germany who knows its international now
any chance of one of them confessing someday
and your general
ever ask him
his name
some story the whole thing its like it never happened
just think just think  what happened to our country  to the world  because of that murder vietnam racial conflict breakdown of law drugs thought control guilt assassinations secret government fear of the frontier
more than ten years
never touched me
i dont know if i should talk about this
if you buy what you read in the paper
i didnt say that  all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out
well i guess now that guys dead it dont really matter it was about the people hanging around the office that summer  i wasnt really part of the operation you know  i was handling the privateeye work for guy when that came in  not much did  but thats why i was there it was a nuthouse  there were all these cubans coming and going  they all looked alike to me
was he there often
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain  ferrie handled a lot of the training  there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba  a few americans got trained too  nazi types mercenaries  but ferrie was the craziest
and oswald
anything more specific jack  its important
there was one guy i dont know big guy business guy white hair  i saw him come into the office once he looked out of place yknow  like a society guy  cant remember his name  oswald was with him
bertrand  clay bertrand
clay bertrand  hes in the warren report  he tried to get oswald a lawyer  was kennedy ever discussed jack
the assassination jack
hold on jack  whats the problem
nobody knows what were talking about jack
its a contradiction numa get used to them  the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets  or fake secrets
even your own wife numa  any of you want to quit do me a favor put us out of our misery
you just need some sleep lou  it wont look so bad when

in his inside coat pocket
i went to give him his refund so he wouldnt have to come here
i found out
i told jackie and jackie said you wanted him
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here
can she afford a good one is the question otherwise shell be in sybill brand three weeks easy before the public defender gets around to her
hey jackie
she wants to make a deal
she almost sounds scared
she wants to go back to work
she hasnt one into specifics yet shes been waiting for you
she aint said it but shes not stupid she knows its you who wants her
every step of this goes in my report  i am now taking a manila envelope from the subjects flight bag

the usual things im a flight attendant with cabo air
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms would you mind if we looked in that bag
you have the right to say no and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant and if i dont want to go through all that trouble i could just take you in on suspicion
if i were to tell you no it isnt
im not saying another word
arrest me
oh youre both in 1985 you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours he did time and you got off but that ended your career with the big airlines cut to thirteen years later youre fortyfour years of age youre flying for the shittiest little shuttlefucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is where you make a whopping twelvethousand dollars a year that aint a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career and to top it off youre going to jail now true the judge even with your prior will probably only give you a year or two but this doesnt seem like the time of life you got years to throw away  now we dont like trying losers like theyre criminals but in the absence of a criminal we will try you now wasnt this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker
while youre at it let me see what else is in there you mind
whats in it
thats my diet shit
im tellin you i dont know nothin about that fuckin shit
take your time
help you get ordell robbie
course i do  i deliver money for him
can you do it or not
fine
whats her name
she leaves somebodyll be on her
okay
who do you think i am
can i see your id
in cash
sure ever been to the riverbottom
its okay its a cop hangout
i thought you might want a drink
we could stop at the hilton by the airport
its kind of a sports bar
why does it need to be dark
great
ten pounds i lose it and put it back on
whats your brand
was she helpful
you know i figured out the other day ive written something like fifteen thousand bonds since ive been in the business id say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related if you want i can help you look at your options
i am as a matter of fact
so far ive been told i can cooperate and get probation maybe or i can stand mute and get as much as five years does that sound right
shit
sure
yeah but thats not what this was about they were fuckin waitin for my ass they knew i had that money they even knew the amount the one who searched my bag from lapd dargus hardly even looked at it oh id say theres fifty thousand here what would you say but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs and i could tell they didnt want to do that
i had em too i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down then their asses lucked out and found that coke
who gave me the money and who i was giving it to and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off said it was him who told them bout me
thats him how do you know em
ordell pick up his bond
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont
i didnt
ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms
it was the other guy who busted me
i have a pretty good idea ordell aint no bootlegger and i doubt hes smugglin cuban cigars so that only leaves one thing an atf man would be interested in
how many trips did you make
hes got that kinda money
cash poor
if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law why not pack a hundred grand
ask atf they might give you permission
well jackie you got caught youre gonna have to give em something
give em what you got offer to help show a willingness to be helpful you want to stay out of jail dont you
i think maybe i have more options than i thought
i am have a seat
i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail
you went out this morning and bought a gun
you went out this morning and bought a gun
yeah
sure
it looks nice
i got a few but i cant afford to start all over again i got too much time and money invested in my records
uhhuh
the delfonics
74 i think
are you
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
well if the atf guy is the one who wants you thatll only interest him up to a point
howd you find that out
he called you
what whatd you do
why
no thanks theres gotta be other ways to get it out
same way i been doin but first they got to let me go back to work
if i get let off otherwise fuck em
i aint goin to jail and i aint doin that probation thing again
youre not old you look great
its not really something i think about
okay im a little sensitive about my hair it started falling out ten years ago so i did something about it
im fine with it or i wouldnt of done it i did it to feel better about myself and i do when i look in the mirror it looks like me
you know i cant really feel too sorry for you in that department
bigger
i just feel like im always starting over you said how many bonds you wrote
well ive flown seven million miles and ive been waitin on people almost twenty years the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry i make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits aint worth a damn and now with this arrest hanging over my head im scared if i lose my job i gotta start all over again but i got nothin to start over with ill be stuck with whatever i can get and that scares me more than ordell
surprise
i know ignoring me whatre you up to
whatd ya see
how was it
oh are you does she know that
well id never be so bold as to speak for all men but as or myself and a few of my friends thats definitely the case theres a lot of actresses out there you like and theres some you have crushes on but theres always one who you love and with her its sorta like going steady
for now these relationships never last too long
sandra bullock you know her
shes adorable but i had to end it
im old enough to be her father
i dont care
i go back to work tomorrow
they seem to like the idea
yea but im going to dress it up put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here
he always just picked it up at my place but with atf involved i want to stage it you know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck were doin then its up to ray nicolet the atf guy to follow the shopping bag
right around here in the food court
im helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him
yeah we were goin over everything thats why all the bags
i know i got your message ray wanted to have dinner he wanted to talk about the sting were plotting thats what he calls it a sting hes being real nice to me
maybe but im thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself
hes setting me up to make a proposition
you dont propose something like that unless youre pretty sure the other persons into it
not really but i knew this narcotics cop one time told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station his exact words
he werent bullshittin either cause later he was suspended and forced to retire
no harm in that hes a young guy havin fun being a cop i know the type trust me on this hes more interested in ordell than the money if hes gonna do anything suspect itll be cutting corners to get the conviction but he wouldnt walk off with the money its evidence
what if i was in nicolets place
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would i take it
a halfamillion dollars will always be missed
okay sure i might be tempted especially now since im getting out of the bail bonds business
why
when did you decide
the day you got me out of jail
wait a minute after we were together you went and snuck into a guys house
and went to this guys house in el monte and i waited for him
shoot him with the stun gun while hes incapacitated cuff him take em to county
thats my job
he never came home but im sitting on the couch in the dark holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew  so after a couple hours i think what am i doing here nineteen years of this shit so i made up my mind thats it
more or less
which one
i believe i said id be tempted
what if ive figured a way
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now its only money
thats what you do to go through with the shit you start you rationalize i can do this max i know i can but i cant do it without you
do you think they bought it
you know a good cop wont let you know he knows youre fulla shit
dont be so literal ray believed it
well you know im not going to show him the whole amount hell see fifty thousand
in the bag underneath
he wont  i mean he didnt the last time hell be expecting fifty thousand and there it is  on top
not really if he finds it i say mr walker put the money in and i didnt know nothing about it like the coke
yeah but im not in jail and i tried
thats why you dont make a move till i come out of the fitting room
well a suit theres one i had my eye on
all winston had to do was ask around ordells living in long beach with a woman junkie
people talk to winston hes street same as them they trust him they get busted they know somebody who can bond them out i thought i might drop in on him hell no doubt be surprised to see me
on the phone i told him i have the ten thousand he put up for your bond i could bring the money and the papers for him to sign walk out and call the sheriffs department
everybody wants him hes a homicide suspect it doesnt matter who brings him in hes gonna name you as an accessory
its not that simple
so how do we give ordell to nicolet
set him up
tell him you want to see him
why
what do you tell nicolet
we get ordell to come to my office nicolet  is he already there or does he come busting in while were chatting
what if he hears something hes not supposed to
less ten percent
i hesitated taking that much
im sure
whats he doing
did you tell him you were leaving
theyve confiscated all his other stuff but this ones sorta left over the registrations in the glove box the keys were under the seat whats a matter havent you ever borrowed someones car
i didnt say you did
i know
im fiftyfiveyears old i cant blame anybody for anything i do
youll get over that
spain
start off in madrid ever been there
thanks but you have a good time
thank you for saying that but no my business
im just tired in general
well thats the states offer if you plead to possession and tell lapd what they want to know your bond will be set at onethousand dollars if you dont lapd will request one at twentyfive thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight if you dont post it or dont know anyone who can youll spend six to eight weeks in county before your arraignment comes up
i beg your pardon
and cooperate you might get probation
with the prior you could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge you want to think about it you got two minutes before were up
do you live together
not every day
then you dont see him for a few days
you know whats in the bag youre taking
well sheronda it was nice talking to you
yeah
what the fuck is that shit
you planted that shit on me
it isnt enough for trafficking but how bout posession with the intent to distribute
can i smoke
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job
i need it tomorrow if i dont show up for work tomorrow im fired
if im working i can help you
you never asked me if i did or not
he sells guns
no
he told me besides why else would an atf man be after him
short of wearing a wire ill do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail and in exchange for my help i need permission to leave the country and immunity
what are you doing
i thought you were going to let this one through
a broadway shopping bag
you two meet
you talk to him
his full name is louis gara he just got out from serving four years in susanville
bank robbery do you know what he does for ordell
weve been following mr gara and hes definitely working for ordell
ever meet her or they talk about her
whos the other one
whats her story
and splittin with her
what did you say
she told you that
was she there
but she mentioned beaumont by name
well this sounds like a lady id like to have a word with so everythings set for tomorrow
well its true isnt it after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else what do you think
oh thats taken care of i called the state attorneys office you were nofiled this morning in circuit court
i was told ten thousand in each pack
i never have its not my money
what to put one of these in my pocket
if i did id have to give you one wouldnt i or we could take what we want no one knows how much there is except us right
after all it dont belong to nobody right
yeah well its not a point of view that atf shares once we make it evidence it belongs to us you are now officially out of trouble dont do nothing stupid now
im glad you realize that saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you  put this in your shopping bag its what i expect to find when i look in sherondas comprende
you didnt i would think with all this on your mind youd wait till after
but you didnt do that
she didnt give me one i told you before melanie wasnt part of the plan ordell must of told her to do it she bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off what am i supposed to do go after her im in my fucking underwear i had to get dressed before i could do anything so i put this back on cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform
i had to i was frantic i didnt know what to do
i went looking for you i went straight to the bookstore cause thats where you were last time but you werent there how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened you didnt tell me how to do that did you i knew i was under surveillance so when i couldnt spot anybody i started yelling
not in the fitting room
this guy with melanie that was louis gara
its possible youre saying you dont have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand
youd take a polygraph on it
i sure hope you havent done anything dumb jackie

it was our idea to take the picture wasnt it
gonna have to put up cash
you have cash what do you need me for
cost you a thousand for the bond
fella named beaumont they have him up at county it started out drunk driving but they wrote it up possession of a concealed weapon dumb monkeyass had a pistol on him
they ran his name and got a hit hes been in before
you think you could do that
beaumont thats the only name i know
you go wait in the car wait a minute
livingston huh
you dont say
havent a clue
will they consider this a violation of his probation
man he wont like that beaumont dont got a doin time disposition
ordell robbie ordell robb ie 1436 florence boulevard compton 90222
house
beaumont aint going nowhere  where do i sign
yes
the door was opened so i just came right in
i got some more business for ya
she is an airline stewardess got caught coming back from mexico with some blow they set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand now what i was thinkin you could use the ten thousand you owe me from beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess
they fuckin wit her they callin it possession with intent a black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her they call that shit intent same shit happened to a movie star its possession
she had i believe it was fifty grand on her too there was a cop at the hearing young guy with lapd wanted her bond set at twenty five thousand saying there was a risk of flight jackie being a stewardess and all
what
hear what
did the police contact you
the stewardess do you know her last name
what does she do for you
beaumont worked for you
was she
youre not my client until you get busted and i bond you out
cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are you got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand
you want me to speculate on what you do id say youre in the drug business except the moneys moving in the wrong direction whatever youre into you seem to be getting away with it so more power to you okay you want another bond and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on beaumont to the stewardess that means paperwork i have to get a death certificate present it to the court fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral then type up another application an indemnity agreement 
im telling you what i have to do what you have to do in case you forgot is come up with premium of a thousand bucks
well come back when you do and ill bond out the stewardess
if i dont see it in front of me youre right it aint shit
ordell this isnt a bar an you dont have a tab
falsely accused she didnt come back from mexico with cocaine on her
is white guilt supposed to make me forget im running a business
is that what i think it is
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older
mister robbie isnt it i have the ten thousand you put up isnt that why you called
she got off huh
looky here i know you helped her and i know you know what i want jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers long as at the end of that story she hands over my money she do that were still friends now she dont wanna be my friend no more tell her to think about ol louis and if she tries to turn me in ill name her ass as my accessory well go upstate together hand in handcuffed hand now that shits a promise understand what im sayin you tell her that and ill call you back
i thought you might be asleep

i have a bond receipt for you to sign
she wants to give you your money if she didnt thered be cops batter ramming the door right now
winston found you
thats what winston does he finds people who dont want to be found

she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it
lift up your pant leg you help her

excuse me but what are you talking about didnt they catch the shark this afternoon it was on the cape station news
thank you
can you do that
no home here
you going to be all right
ill see you back soon theres an extra pair of glasses in your black socks and theres some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit
whatll i tell the kids
do i need any more authority
all im saying is that amity is a summer town  we need summer dollars and if they cant swim here theyll use the beaches at cape cod or long island
i was only reacting to what i was told
martin we hired the best man we could find
no need to involve outsiders in our business martin
i didnt agree to that
thats good thats real good ben meadows getting pictures for the paper
matt hooper the specialist they send down from the oceanographic institute
be reasonable boys  this isnt the time or the place to do some kind of halfassed autopsy on a fish ben  do you have all the pictures you need
lets all get out of here this place stinks
what kind of a shark did you say it was
i dont thing either of you is familiar with our problems
larry we can reopen the beaches in august
why
i dont know if i can do that without a
maybe we can save august
i was acting in the towns best interests
my kids were on that beach
youre tellin me i swear this town has gone crazy
who are you
no it was local jurisdiction
no we just checked the beach
you did it did ben gardner catch this
what dya mean
swell
lets all have a drink
yeah like the kid on your beach i wish i couldve examined that shark they caught
about half of them a lot of missing swimmers are really shark victims
rogue
its called territoriality its a theory
you could say that
what stinks so bad
half a flounder hmmm a burlap bag a paint can aha
just as i thought he drifted up here with the gulf stream from southern waters
florida license plate
no but tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean they eat anything but this one didnt eat any people theres nothing here
what do we do
chum
depthfinder fathometer sonar closedcircuit tv  fore and aft  rdf single side band  and two loose nuts behind the wheel
sometimes  look here  something big probably a school of mackerel clumped together and staying right with us
i bought it  both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me stocks went up so i dont have to touch my principal
it is a job im not fooling around like some amateur its my life
i want to check something hold my feet
they mustve hit something
why dont we just tow it in
be careful for chrissake
a white a great white i found a tooth buried in the hull he mustve attacked i knew it gardners dead in there i didnt see the mate
youre situation here suggests that a great white has staked out a claim in the waters around amity island and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water
a sharks attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming  you cant avoid it
i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there
that means closing the beaches
out there is a perfect engine an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution  it swims and eats and thats all look at that those proportions are correct  i know sharks
i wish it would rain
this is quite a place
you were on the indianapolis in 45 jesus
its a whale out there
i cant stand here doing nothing

get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some beach closed signs and let polly do the printing
that wasnt funny
looks more like the readers of the national enquirer
what else couldve done that
doctor youre the one who told me what it was
i agree if shes going to advertise i wouldnt recommend outoftown papers amity people could take care of this
whats going on with the beaches chief
its only twothirty what are you tired
screw lamb  lets shoot the sirloin
set
twenty years

like those cousteau specials on television i think its for the kids but i love them
i saw a show with sea otters and a big turtle mikey loved it made me promise to get him one will you live on the boat

real fine stuff but it wont mean a thing to mr whitey of course he didnt go to schools in electronics he was born with what he does best eat hes a swimming appetite course he might eat this stuff but then ive seen him eat a rocking chair too  next time ask me
it aint a big mac  the expert dont approve what do you thing youre closer to the situation 
aye aye sir stand by to repel boarders poop the mainsail argh jim boy
let it go dont waste your time
look  you may be a big yahoo in the lab but out here youre just supercargo and youll do as i say or you can take your gear and backstroke home now get down here

your mom must be really glad youre not taking me
im not mad im in a fucking great mood despite the fact that im trapped in a fat suit i cant take off despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday
what
not this time you dont have any reason to be mad at me you broke my heart i should be royally ticked at you man i should be really cheesed off i shouldnt want to talk to you anymore
like id marry you you would be the meanest wife of all time and anyway i know you werent bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv the blair witch project was on starz and you were like oh i want to watch this but we should make out instead la la la
yeah well i still have your underwear

also i think im in love with you
no for real i think you are the coolest person ive ever met and you dont even have to try
no youre naturally smart you always think of the funniest things to do remember when you passed me that postcard during spanish class and it was addressed like junebug macguff row 4 third seat from the blackboard and it said im having fun in barcelona  wish you were here that was hilarious
plus youre the only person who doesnt stare at my stomach all the fucking time you actually look at my face and every time i look at you the baby starts kicking me super hard
i think its because my heart starts pounding when i see you
basically im completely smitten with you and i dont care if im making an ass out of myself right now because youve seen me make an ass out of myself a million times and you still want to be my friend
thats all i need from you thats more than i could ever ask for youre just golden dude
okay

you are always trying to keep it real im in love with how you feel i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
the pebbles forgive me the trees forgive me so why cant you forgive me i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
oh hey vijay
yup
yup
yup
i dont really know anything about it
i cant grow a moustache it never comes in evenly
well there we have it would you like to know the sex
i just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here its obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in
no i guess not
excuse me
im an ultrasound technician maam
what are you talking about
no i mean the father whos the father juno
i think kids get bored and have intercourse and i think junebug was a dummy about it but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out
youre not going to be a poppop and junos not going to be a ma somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation i friggin hope
oh god yeah but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs
oh mac no hes a sweet kid you know it wasnt his idea
i would never barf in your urn brenda maybe lb did it
hon did you get expelled
well i was just asking it seemed plausible
but im going to give it up for adoption i already found the perfect people
junebug that is a tough tough thing to do probably tougher than you can understand right now
well youre a brave young lady youre made of stronger stuff than i thought youre a little viking
first things first we have to get you healthy you need prenatal vitamins incidentally theyll do incredible things for your nails so thats a plus oh and we need to schedule a doctors appointment find out where youre going to deliver
i drove to st cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound and i wound up staying for a couple of hours
they said they wanted to know about this stuff they said to keep them updated so i did
i dont know i just did and while we were waiting for vanessa mark and i watched the wizard of gore and he burned me some cds of weird music hes kind of cool
listen brenduhhh i think youre the one overstepping boundaries youre acting like youre the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else besides who cares if hes married i can have friends who are married
you dont know anything about me
yeah because youre allergic to their saliva ive made a lot of sacrifices for you juno and in a couple years youre going to move out  and im getting weimaraners
oh go fly a kite
its called a spinal block and you cant have it yet honey the doctor said youre not dilated enough
well honey doctors are sadists who like to play god and watch lesser people scream
it really didnt hurt that bad having him
im a junior
oh uh my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said i was twelve weeks
well then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved then
no josh i dont take orders not from you and not from any man
something happened because your eyes are very cold theyre very cold josh theyre cold lying eyes
yes they are josh since mankato they have been lying eyes
fine call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brothers college just because you had four smirnoff ices and a bottle of snow peak peach flavored boones
geeeerta rauuuss
cool well lets sit down and get to know each other a bit
well i just have the baby and give it to you right
technically that would be kickin it old testament
sorry i was just getting something
what no do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something
i dont get a klepto vibe from you evil genius maybe arsonist wouldnt rule it out
you should be happy holmes im giving you and vanessa the gift of life sweet screaming pooping life and you dont even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in
blood and guts
wow you get a whole room in your own house shes got you on a long leash there mark
what do you play
oh
sorry i swear im not a gear snob
tell me about it i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago and one night we opened for the melvins do you know who the melvins are
well we were playing with them and i busted this guitar onstage it cost me 800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed
93 im telling you that was the best time for rock and roll
you werent even alive
yeah
ive got something really cool to show you guys is vanessa here
come on in you wanna ginseng cooler
i dont know something to do with the fourpacks  theyre not bad

commercials
have you seen those ads for titanium power mens deodorant
i wrote that
theyd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home
youre kidding
oh is he bald and amorphous
the doctor can tell but i decided not to know i want it to be a big surprise
thats what you think i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuterbabies thats born without junk
you know its parts
yeah
well dont worry about it my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy she wont even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red mms hope youre ready
its only my favorite song its sonic youth doing superstar by the carpenters
you havent heard the carpenters like this listen
hey i like this
you dont have to do that
i didnt but its a threeway tie between the stooges patti smith and the runaways
oh yeah its herschel gordon lewis hes the ultimate master of horror
frankly this looks kind of stupid
heres to dovetailing interests
well sort of vanessa likes madison for a girl
god pretentious much i guess everyone should have a mysterious name like juno huh
that suits you
you know not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this
youre something else
why what the big deal
ill handle this im really good at diffusing momtype rage
i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises
yeah mall madness huh
why
you should have gone to china i heard they give away babies like free ipods they shoot em out of those tshirt guns at sports events
so ive been spending a lot of time listening to that weird cd you made me
i sort of like it i mean its cute
well when youre used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison
consider it your musical education
okay stop surfing porn and get back to work just wanted to say hi
is vanessa here
come on i have something for you
hilarious no i just keep all of my old comics down here and i want to show you one of them
youre gonna like this i promise

paulie bleeker i didnt know he had it in him

i drank like ten tons of sunny delight anyway yeah im pregnant and youre shockingly cavalier
unfortunately yes
thats the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take
i know women now i guess the commercial says they help women now
eh ill call them myself but i do need your help with something very urgent
that is sick man
nah it was a premeditated act the sex i mean not getting pregnant
like a year ago in spanish class
its extremely complicated and id rather not talk about it in my fragile state
it was magnificent man
i couldnt do it leah it smelled like a dentist in there they had these really horrible magazines with like spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains like someone read them in the tub and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers and she told me about her boyfriends pie balls and suchin kuah was there and she told me the baby had fingernails fingernails
im staying pregnant le
what does that even mean anyway i got to thinking on the way over i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing you know like a woman with a bum ovary or something or some nice lesbos
i know maybe theyll canonize me for being so selfless
bleeker and i were going to go to gettysburg for spring break
there are ads for parents
come on leah i cant scope out wannabe parents in the penny saver thats tacky thats like buying clothes at the pump n munch
yeah but it sucks for free
theres a guy in here whos giving away a piano free for the hauling we should put it in bleekers yard
no i heard you i just cant give the baby to people who describe themselves as wholesome im looking for something a little edgier
i was thinking a graphic designer midthirties and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass but im trying to not be too particular
yeesh they sound like a cult besides theyre greedy bitches they already have three kids
im pregnant

he almost always killed strangers spent years moving on from one place to another that made it real hard to track him down
then some
dahlia no
some people think its because he never killed again he just disappeared back into society
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again and again until someone stopped him

a little bit but i didnt really want her to
i dont know thats too easy i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick thats so easy
i want to knock her guard down i mean theres a whole philosophy behind it having a virgin suck your dick thats basic because theres nothing lost

thats right thats why foreplay is better than sex
because he can like climax you up to that
have you ever swallowed it before
right you know its not like you know theres a difference between sex making love and fucking
making love is like

yeah
its really slow its slow boring
yeah it depends cause like this one time with eric when we got blasted at his house and smash j and dj flipper was there
and we were blasted and he must have been dumb horney and he just pulled me over to the bed and they were in the room like getting dressed like getting ready to go to go to disco
but then the sex gets into the way and youre like what happened what the hell happened

ok
chess tournaments can be boring sometimes  people have a lot of free time  they like to gossip
yes
what kind of problem
what are you saying
casual  you were boning her werent you
you are  i dont like you
it means if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent
you like to play games dont you peter
oh well be back  you can bet on it
no
he says its a game  all games have a strategy
his victims arent random  it only means that they appear to be random theres a connection we just have to find it
what
lets see how much he wants to play
you think youre going to catch him on a trace  everything he does is planned out well in advance  the only way were going to get him is to rattle him  make him slip up
maybe you should
you dont have an investigation without me  you got that
i wouldnt know
howd you get in here
no it wasnt
what do you want
i used to  with my old man  he taught me how to hunt and trap  trappings a lot harder than most people think  we used to go after raccoons mostly theyd get into our garbage our fields  when an animal cant live peacefully with those around it it has to be destroyed  but theyre crafty little devils  you see the trick is you can put your trap down but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent  you ever smell raccoon scent  smells like shit but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy  hell walk right up to that trap even though it dont look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it  you know why  cause he cant help himself  the scent drives him  so if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is  lay down the scent  and sooner or later hell walk right into the trap
well then you just gotta find out where he is  and once youre sure where he is  you shoot the fucker
no i need the original note
then whats he talking about
homesearchers
i was at the beach
im positive
fuck you  im tired of your goddam accusations  if you want to arrest me go ahead  otherwise back off
get off me
what
sit down
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer
youre right i cant make you do it besides youre probably gonna be too busy with the franchise tax board anyway
i gotta friend over there  he was telling me things are kind of slow so i figured id give him a call have him come down here and look through your records  you know give him something to do
run it down
local
hes got an answer for everything but he doesnt have an alibi
i dont know but i think youre right hes lying
what was your relationship with her
im sorry this is just too convenient
could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal
anything
check with the state  if hes never killed outside of washington the fbi wouldnt have it  nolan
yeah i am  i think hes playing us if i was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else
maybe hes going to drug her
shes unconscious but they think shes going to make it
ive seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this yurilivich
sanderson
find him  i want to talk to him
its a voice modulator
ive got a feeling were going to go the distance with him  let him sweat for a little while
you werent mad at him for picking up the phone
hes one of the best chess players in the world  who better to play a game with
i dont know  maybe theres two of them  maybe he hired some wino to make the calls
did anyone stand out
did anyone look suspicious  think
what was suspicious about him
but a hundred men could move him
he was with me
oh cmon  were not going to spend any more time on this crap are we  it doesnt mean anything  its sanderson
jesus youre sleeping with the guy youve lost your perspective  you cant possibly be unbiased
you couldnt find your dick in a wind storm
who is this
i havent got time for this
just a second  hello
yes  why did you kill debi rutlege
did you know her
we all have paths to follow  you hope yours will lead you to me
thats something youll have to figure out for yourself  really peter you cant expect me to answer such direct questions
you dont want to think and thats why ill win  im already two points ahead
where is she
if you got something to say to me just come out and say it
youre not going to tell me that
do you know what im doing right now peter  im looking at the name of the girl im going to kill tonight
not really
because shes the type
i know what i said  she looks just like
i really wish youd stop trying to maneuver me  i find it irritating not to mention insulting
youre not playing very well  there are clues all around you and you keep missing them
then call them
why are you doing this  you must have some idea of the pain youre causing people
please i dont want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions it would detract from the game
i couldnt say it any better than huxley
so is mine within the framework of my rules
if its so important why dont you just tell me
you like to brag dont you
you heard me  why did you go out to the institute looking for her
i couldnt tell you that  it would ruin the game
very nice speech peter  did you rehearse that or was it impromptu  theres an old wooden bench in the garden  next to it is a rock  youll find a message for you under it  lets see if youre as clever as you think you are
last night was very exciting wasnt it  have you figured out what im doing
very good
i used a variation  you should have anticipated that  have you figured out the message
the police havent told you
im beginning to think it doesnt mean anything  remember eventually revenge 
you sonofabitch
if you kill tonight and im in jail the police will know im innocent
ive figured out the message
congratulations on your daring escape you just missed me by a few seconds  its check peter
shes in the other room  i just wanted you to know she wasnt dead yet but its time for her to die now
the games over  you lost
no  as usual youre wrong  it is her i want  killing you would be easy living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat
youre groping  i have been fair its my move now
dont beg peter  she has to die  i cant win unless she dies
no  wait
very good  how did you know
you told me  when you called you said she was in the other room  drop the knife
you dont understand
they took away the game because of him my father left and my mother  there was so much blood it covered everything
i think your mother knows that now why dont you put the knife down  put it down david
thanks
oh i put a few games on for your daughter  i hope you dont mind
can we correlate data  look for specific things like players ages stuff like that
okay  run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the island
set up some pieces on the big board
mister sanderson theyll be hundreds of thousands of games
have computer search for anyone thats used that opening against me  there cant be more than a handful
never mind  he died two years ago
hes in his seventies and lives in holland
new york  1986  viktor yurilivich
you still havent figured it out have you   you think that ive put you through an ordeal  my scars run so much deeper than yours
the scars on your chest  from where i stabbed you with my fountain pen
youre damn right  im a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer
oh well we wouldnt want to disturb your guests would we
you could have been honest with me for starters  we work together  i have to be able to trust you
the same type as the girl who got killed  jesus alan the guy could be a psychopath
dont patronize me  you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didnt warn me
fuck off
i just cant believe it
how come the police never had a record of sanderson before  this doesnt come out of nowhere there has to be a history
im just nervous  sorry
he already did once
why did he what
he was watching you
youre losing me
uh huh
he went down to the lobby for a minute he should be right back  would you like come in
not really  its pretty boring
boys
of course
how do you know that  did he say something
nice meeting you
my cheering section
i cant sleep  my beds lumpy
that has nothing to do with it
okay
mrs lutz  she also told me that mr lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great grandmasters in the spirit world
no but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from ohio
nothing
thanks david
for what
im sorry honey i cant  not today
whos kathy
not much  theres no sign of a break in  i think she let him in
six eight hours tops
not that i can see  well know more once i get the lab reports back from seattle
bingo
not much  i dont think she was raped theres no bruising or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region  and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath
no prints
no frank  no prints
theres only two hardware stores on the whole island  well check that out what about the blood
thats great
yeah
id say at least eighteen hours
well what  i told you this was a stupid idea  you cant learn anything from someone in a few minutes
im a psychologist frank not a psychic  whats this all about anyway
were not sure
we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation
its important
and this jeremy
but we heard him
well the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority  and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim
anything else
i was thinking the same thing  he must be local  its logical for him to assume that the police would be there but he recognized andys voice and called him by name  what about this
meaning
call dispatch  double the patrols  i want that area blanketed
i know that  ive seen the photos
peters right captain  hes got to be forced into making a mistake
what did he mean by huxley
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end
he moves around a lot  why
thats a big area to cover
yes  why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure
about a quarter to one
what are you saying  that im seeing what i want to see  that im protecting a murderer  what
what does that mean
were going to work on the message
the most logical choice
no  he was wearing a mask but i saw the cut on his wrist  it was peter
ive got a room at the institute i use when i stay late
you know i hate to say i told you so but i warned her  coming home at all hours of the night  a young girl new to the city  this neighborhood aint what it used to be
ten days ago
through a rental agency
only in passing  to say hello to
here  i played gregory lutz
to my room and then i went for a walk
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow
i got it from the tournament directory
i dont know  i was afraid thered be hours of questions  i cant afford to miss a game
weve already met  havent we doctor
thats alright  well take it from here
wee willie winkie runs though the street  we think he might be making a reference to himself
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown  he could be saying the house hes picked is two stories
we think he might be making a reference to drugs  miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine
is  did you tell him about the institute
it doesnt make sense
how can he be playing chess with you youre not making any moves against him
thats all he needs  hes making the moves  its an opening  i just cant remember the name  okay its a game  hes starting it so he moves first  hes white  e2e4
but he had to dump the body there to make the move
a building
he uses castlesplural   then says cant move me  singular  not cant move us
wait a minute  theres an apartment in that area called the castle arms
are we going to go through this again
i went out
maybe he just got tired of covering for you
i understand that this is just another one of your games
i signed the confession  what about the car
its over peter  lets stop the games  im not sending a car
he knows youre aware of that
on a variation yes  but it must be a variation that is unique
you dont win by playing it safe peter
our computer went on the fritz again david came up to fix it
ive got be here for the police when they come  then ive got to practise in case you forgot im in the middle of a match right now
i want to be the best i can
just thought you might want to talk
whatevers on your mind
mate in five
no
yeah  just let me grab a shower
hi sara  this is doctor sheppard  i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called principals and tactics by anton berger
thank you  im at 6397393
sara this is doctor sheppard  i called you earlier about a book
could you please do me a big favor  in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess  could you look and tell me what they are
what are they please
its alright
yes
how come you dont stay with them
no  i dont
uh huh
yes
when i was very young
not really  you see your goal and you go after it  anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed
chess is a reflection of life  life is violent  the strong win  the weak perish
if youre asking me if im passionate about what i do the answer is yes without passion nothing moves us whats your passion
i see  this is going to be a very polite conversation  what shall we discuss  the weather  movies
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation
it is
are we talking about me or chess
each circumstance requires a different tactic
getting too hot in here for you
nothing  i just came in for a steam
did you think it was going to be easy you think he was going to lay it out at your feet
i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down
i cant right now  ive got a game
she could be dead now
i dont think i could
you sound like my mother
does whats going on bother you at all or are you just wearing your game face
another kind of game
this isnt a game
how can you look at it so clinically
thats true  but the emotion is still there  they just learn to control it
of course
lets change the subject
i think its best if we dont ask too many personal questions  i want to keep things on a professional level
thats not fair
very good  spoken like a true psychologist  when confronted with the prospect of your own reality hide behind quotations  what is that masters and johnson
i just wanted to know if youre involved with anyone  let me ask you something  do your colleagues know if youre involved or not
why
youre not
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw
how could you  unless you were there
you know andy thinks youre doing this
no
because i think hes wrong
no  but im open to distractions
you always want to talk about me  what about you
no  you were talking about chess
i dunno  wheres erica mother
im sorry
it mustve been very hard on erica
and you
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games
yes you are  youre playing word games
im just trying to get to know you peter
what are you talking about  you dont even know me
then show me who you are
youve got to face the things you feel
i said i didnt plan on getting involved
no
call room service
what do you want on it
would you settle for pepperoni
the line was busy  ill try again
i thought you said the line was busy
whats wrong
then why are you backing up
admit what  that i was right about you in the steam room  that youre willing to do anything to find out what you want  would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room
how could you think that kathy  how could you even consider it
for emphasis
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine  violent
what
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid
can i come in
im not looking for an apology peter
i want someone i can get close to i dont know if thats possible with you
no listen  you have no idea of the kind of pressure im under right now
i cant think any more unless its about you  ill be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move i think about how you look when you smile  remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard  ever since my wife died ive been  ive been afraid of getting too close to someone again  afraid of losing them
you dont understand
its not that easy
but i do
because she killed herself
why not
maybe youre afraid of what it says
it could be anything
frank told me
he didnt tell you either
of course not
are you going to come tonight
i got lucky
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future
im sure you are
youre getting sloppy yurilivich youre nervous
well you should be because this time im going to win
i dont have to go through with it either
oh that  i know what you mean  i had nightmares all week
last night was the worst i dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other and walked like a penguin
thats worse
well youre beautiful
if youre going to marry a warrior youd best get used to it
uwhatu
were not married uyetu
never mind my ears go away
maybe youd better look around for another candidate i dont think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush
thank you but i can wait
about what
colwyn
no they watch me closely but they havent harmed me
in a great fortress in the mountains wait somethings happening
colwyn 
i dont know its a maze of tunnels i cant see out
i know it
colwyn colwyn  i love you colwyn
you must move away from the center
i dont know how
all directions are the same here
move quickly we are coming for you we are in the fortress
come quickly colwyn i can see the eyes of the beast
that way i can feel the cold
yes
it was a platonic kiss father
you cant reach her  through the door  quickly
i wont leave you here
i must follow the slayers theyve taken lyssa
does the queen live
turolds son was to marry her
i have lived in this place like my fathers before me guarding the old knowledge i knew when i had no son that the great war would come in my time and that i would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king come
i have no extraordinary powers
in the old books its called a glaive
two or three days while lyssa is in their hands
but there is another entrance to this place
you have rope
you wont have to
reach out farther call to her
she was in a great fortress first in the mountains then in the jungle how is that possible
the fortress moves
then even if lyssa tells us where she is well never be able to reach her for they will never allow the fortress to rise near us
then we must be ready five leagues from here is the eastern tower i know the barons who hold it good men and brave they will help us
nor will i till my bride is beside me
yes they will be more help than highborn barons
everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death
what do you see
yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below
the deeper she goes the harder it is to contact her once she is below the second level you will not be able to reach her at all
she is too deep the curved tunnel we saw is part of the vortex the place of the beast
no then they were led by his underlings but i knew he had come this time from the ferocity of their onslaught from their use of the fortress they use up much of their strength to do these things they are taking great risks
im not sure
you will know in good time
there is no other way you asked me why the beast had come this time
he has come for lyssa
like you she has extraordinary powers he would make her his queen
no she must agree of her own free will
you are young you dont understand the attraction of great power and you forget the pain of long waiting
yes
he thinks you betray him with lyssa  colwyn the waters deceive you
he sees betrayal everywhere he will attack us so long as he is conscious
you will tell me her name and we will go together
let us wish him peace
the beast will kill her
lyssa your bracelets bend them straight and cross them
where the spiral begins
i chose the wrong passage
use your sword
cut ucutu
youre coming with us
no you cannot know that
i forbid you
i found the body of the seer in the stream
we must enter the swamp
what will happen
you have done it
saddles
yes it is today
each to his fate
perhaps you think no man would return to me
yes
yes
yes
i ache with it
i cannot take comfort when she has none
i cannot betray my bride
you will not then
i doubt it the water is only an inch deep
a forest near the valley of needles
perhaps he expected to eat it
what business
he saved our lives
i was hoping i might be your friend
i have need of friends
uwhatu oh no better it was me there isnt another good tomato within a hundred leagues
you and i will guard the fire
smart as well as quick now what do you have to give us
fame  thank you no fame is the burial ground of contentment eat it and go hungry count it and go broke seek it and grow mad fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun
how did you know i had sons
hah you dont know me boy
you will follow me
so your sons will speak of you to your grandsons and your grandsons to their grandsons
to the place where death lives
that i promise you
im all right
why do they burn the villages theres nothing to gain
not sleepy either
those are not childs tear a child cries for himself a man cries for those he loves
i knew you would not be thats why i chose you
we must try to get horses
these well pay for
hand over your dinner
they do not exist except in the waters of the swamp where they will remain
what kind of friend do you think i am
well it is true that if i received a royal command i couldnt very well disobey it could i
yes my lord
those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men
at the gallop
subject to the king no doubt
i intend to keep you alive your majesty so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord
colwyn dont be a fool you cant do battle with that thing
would you settle for a boar
me  may i eat with you tonight
i am quell
the swamp of betrayal be glad we dont have to cross it
well meet you at the inn
no
a small house
i cannot go with you my friend
and mine goes with you
no
no
i have a cinnamon bar
you can have half
i    am titch
smart lad  bring me my spices
id wish for a puppy
i only want one
first you desert me and now you mock me go back to your oneeyed friend
i dont think its working
its right behind you
and do you think im not going to eat myself to death this very night huh
would you desert your friends
get me down from here you louts or ill turn you all into pigs
you had better manners as a pig
many villagers are hiding in the forest they need food
we have plenty of hares
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison
i must take the old man to see some sick children kegan will guard you
oh my poor stomach
the greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life blockhead is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of ergo the magnificent
hush
look at its insides
the forest is not safe these days youd best travel with us
the one with red eyes was a dark one the other was a cyclops and it was not you he meant to kill
if that were so youd be dead now he was aiming at the dark one for there is ancient hatred between them once his race had two eyes like other men until his forefathers bargained with the dark ones they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future but they were cheated for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death
and who is uheu that they should join uhimu
well at least im glad to see you have a sense of humor thats the first smile ive seen on that gloomy face of yours    isnt it it isnt oh no oh dear oh now ive gone and done it
no he will master the leader
you know nothing of power you foolish girl you think power is a mighty sword or a strong castle or the paltry magic of an emerald seer power is none of these
then look
these walls do not lie he will betray you
then he will die
he will not come you will be my queen
barak is still strong in the north and tendo holds the high passes but the great desert forts have fallen
it has been taken freylag and all his people slaughtered
the attacks are unceasing by night the dark ones by day those of our people who have sold themselves to them those traitors who are called the slayers
we will hold their power is not unlimited
modred has treated with the dark ones
it is important to assure the succession
i knew
that i am my lady
a match for your son i think
they will have the life that you and i might have had
yes we lost five
how many did you lose
we will have to try again his knowledge is great without it we cannot hope to win
he leads a group of slayers under the leopard banner
such a vision will be opposed who seeks it
with an old voice
yes you have left your place in the needle it is the time then
i will seek the fortress for you
yes it is the western ocean
they will fail for during the day the power of the circle is greater than theirs only at night can they pierce the circle
no they are sad solitary creatures rarely seen
theres an emerald circle a few leagues from here  well find her
many have perished in that maze
yes  like you a king a king of many worlds all enslaved
the widow of the web
that creature helps no one and none who go there return
she has the power to kill
her name is death
fewer will survive them
each to his fate wait for me at the inn if i am not back by dawn you will know my fate and you must go on without me
its a hundred leagues from here
it is not necessary they will not follow
yes they are weakening it takes great power to maintain the fortress and they have expended much
it is too late he has drunk
that is true
ynyr
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you
the most beautiful woman in the world
could not could not betray the girl to whom i was betrothed
no she was not as beautiful
we had no children
you said nothing you told me nothing
where is he my son
it is no trickery
yes
power you have given me what can my power give you
of what
why must you know
you lie
no
tomorrow the fortress of krull will rise with the sun in the valley of reeds but the knowledge is of no use to you no man has ever escaped the web and soon the creature will come for you even here
then the other lyssa will share your fate she will grow old in the fortress as you have grown old here
you cannot stop time go now before it runs out
there is sand enough for only one life go now save the other

i received my bs from the university of pennsylvania my phd from bryn mawr college  i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine during which time i had articles printed in the journal of educational psychology american journal of psychology psychology review and science so i think its safe to say my opinion is valid
hightop nike crosstrainers with heel support and aircushioned soles  theyre nasty

put out a pbs or whatever its called
sergeant im a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression  it is a time when an individual will act overconfident and will act out impractical grandiose plans sometimes these plans can be dangerous
a couple days to a few months if untreated

interesting choice of words i dont remember i just know that i want to

theres no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here were spending all this time together what the fuck
lets face it ben were having fun here ive never done so much talking in my life
so lets dispense with the formalities i want you here now
so im not too concerned with long term plans
that is what i want why dont you go and get your stuff
dont be silly
what
i do i really do  ok i have to do some shopping alone you go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things dont hurry and ill be back before you to let you in
why dont you go in and sit down i have some gifts for you

sorry
ok
because its better for me that way ok
no
i know that
thanks i do understand i was worried about how that would be but now im not and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job
whatever that means open your presents
i threw them into the garbage which was perhaps immoral but i wanted to come to you clean so to speak i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day
do you want to go gambling tonight we could go out and play for a few hours
then come  im going to change watch tv ill be half an hour
when
well then i hope we dont run into any tonight
i expect some kind of loyalty here just because i fuck for money doesnt give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly

last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg the girl must have been taking a break between customers it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and the reason im telling you this epilogue is that i felt that id come full circle

youre a beautiful girl elle
im a man who knows what i want

donovans firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy hes taking on first year interns

aristotle

how about 
i dont know
spill
well what am i supposed to do hes engaged shes got the family six carat on her bony unpolished finger
whatd you do
no
thats terrible
shes from connecticut she belongs to his stupid country club
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights but shes not completely unfortunatelooking
definitely i love him
i couldnt help it it was the most fun ive had since ive been in law school not only was i good enough for warner  i was better than him he has to see serious i am now even donovan was impressed and hes a total hardass
no
look at him hes still scratching his head
thats because men are big fat retards who dont  oh my god
no sometimes i say okay instead of fine
whats the point  look at me
trust me youve got the equipment you just need to read the manual
im so happy for you
great donovan actually said the words good work ms woods he takes me seriously can you believe it
whats the point of staying all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs no ones ever going to take me seriously the people at law school dont warner doesnt  i dont even think my parents take me seriously they wanted me to grow up and become a victorias secret model who marries a rock star now for the first time it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living but i was kidding myself  donovan didnt see me as a lawyer he saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else it turns out i am a joke
licensed attorney or family member
relation
name
you know her
oh god was this like an rsvp thing
although mr huntington makes an excellent point i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life
too bad you and i are the only ones
i know i thought that was very  classy of you
i know he has it sent out
youre kidding
really
what
yes you are
yes he is
hell yes weve got finals to study for in jamaica
you guys are so sweet
you think
i think you should go with red its the color of confidence
why else would he be taking you to the ivy youve been dating for a year  its not like hes trying to impress you
serious who the hell does he think he is youre the most popular month on the usc calendar
thank you i love you too
so
but isnt it kind of hard to get into law school
your scrunchie
why yes margot i do once again we joined hope in the search for her identity as you know shes been brainwashed by the evil stefano 
power yoga
what
no way 
i will
margot
i cant believe you guys are actually here  but this case is important ill make it up to you after finals okay i  promise i really want to do a good job
not yet
the professors yeah they tend to do that socratic method
did she do that to you too
neat
speak up in donovans class he likes people with an opinion sit in the back for royalton he tends to spit when he talks about products liability
wow im glad i met you
thanks again for your help
i wasnt gonna 
my moneys on the angry daughter or the exwife
uh for starters she wont give us an alibi 
shes completely untrustworthy
she married an old man shes made a living on telling women theyre too fat she hawks her crap on the home shopping network
and d brooke is obviously hiding something
but maybe it is 
how do you figure
maybe not to your face
no she cant move for an hour
were here from austen platt jaret  donovan 
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworths relationship
youre going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment shes lying
did you see the icky black color of her hair
i never trust a woman whos not blonde except for my friend serena but thats only because shes a blonde at heart thats the whole reason im starting the blonde legal defense fund
blondes are discriminated against worldwide brookes a blonde and people are saying shes sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband if she was a mousy brunette it would be oh the poor widow
it would be a fullservice law firm by and for blondes providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas i mean think about it  name one blonde intellectual role model
that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination
if she were a true blonde she wouldve left the cheating bastard blondes dont let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixtyyearold man can take
the bags under your eyes youre an attractive man but you need to take better care of yourself
well you should  if you look good you feel good and if you feel good you project joy into the world
fine sorry i brought it up
for a butthead yes
what
gay men know designers straight men dont

law school was a mistake getting this internship was a mistake
going back to la maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team no more navy blue suits no more panty hose no more trying to be something im not
