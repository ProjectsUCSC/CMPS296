mandella eat  starving yourself is a very slow way to die
whats this
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions  youre venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy
the people at this school are so incredibly foul
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his maledominated puking frat boy number one golf team school i have no say at all
william didnt even go to high school
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but im consuming  do you mind
you think thisll work
whatd he say
you went to the party  i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
you didnt have a choice  wheres kat and what have you done with her
you didnt
can you even imagine  who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
listen to you  you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
you  re looking at this from the wrong perspective  were making a statement
have you seen him
william  he asked me to meet him here
i mean woman  how ya doin

i dont understand the allure of dehydrated food  is this something i should be hip to
so tell me about this dance was it fun

katarina stratford  my my  youve been terrorizing ms blaise again

i dont understand patrick  you havent done anything asinine this week are you not feeling well

your eminence there is only one way to settle the matter  and that is to make the journey  i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible
trade your excellency  according to marco polo the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold
if god intended our proximity to asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
dont you realize your words could be considered heretical
asia can be found to the west  and i will prove it
the state has some reason to be interested in this mans proposition your eminence
he is a mercenary  did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions
it wont be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez

and were you never ambitious excellency  or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us
they dont see sin in their nakedness  they live according to nature in a never ending summer the islands are covered with trees filled with blossoms and fruits and
you defend yourself admirably

the ocean is uncrossable
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council
may i speak freely
i know what i see  i see someone who doesnt accept the world as it is  whos not afraid  i see a women who thinks what if
how old are you senor colon
do they have such thoughts
but without your brothers  nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies  you may explore the continent
there is one thing id like to understand why do you want to go back after all this

hi frank coming in please
okay 
dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something
well its nothing really important but its annoying
its about my salary cheques
thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18
really
not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices
well what do you think we ought to do about it
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i suppose the idea was specialized training
oh
no as a matter of fact i didnt
i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told
yes i thought so
how
not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training
i know it would be almost inconceivable
i suppose it isnt logically impossible
well thats something
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
good morning hows it going
oh im fine im wide awake whats up
youre kidding
i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
two more
hal
its the last one
i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them
i guess not
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours
not now hal id like to talk to you about something
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
you probably also know that we found them okay
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear
naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history
well dont worry about it
is your confidence in me fully restored
too bad about frank isnt it
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest
im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
i am prepared to do that anyway

im at space station five darling how are you

bye bye now sweetheart
oh thank you very much
well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
and your charming little daughter
oh thats such a delightful age
hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
how do you do mr miller
well thank you very much for being so understanding
well did you have a pleaant flight
well shall we go through documentation
yes i think so just about then
oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off
well as it happens im on my way up to the moon
im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean
really
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days
thats right
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention
fortunately they did
dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
but you dont have any idea as to what it is
any ideas about the colour
has it been exposed to any sun before now
oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days
when do we arrive at clavius
thank you
what do you mean
i see
well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking
right hal tell me whether the following statements are true or false
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn true or false
our transit time is 257 days is that true
thats true
thats true

jesus christ look at all the dust on my carwhy in the hell dont he take it to a car wash
youd think the guyd be smart enough to know he was being tailed
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id  just leave town
i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you
say do you always work people over like you did luther
doesnt it get tiring
maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain  that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job

they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an 8 am wakeup and put up the dont disturb sign  hes trading his girl for the money  all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind
tell me something  why didnt you just take the money off luther and split

yeah
what the bell happened
how did they get away
which one pulled the trigger
what a screwup
dont duck the bullet cates why didnt you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play
hes got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop ive worked with
where the christ do you think youre going
thats what you say cates
but thats what you say about all of us all the tine  were always the ones fucking up when you tell it
somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel
this guy must have had a 44 like yours jack now hes got yours
billy bear

doesnt look like it
bullshit red tape
i got to wait for a call
i almost forgot  that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him
jesus christ  why the hell didnt you tell me before
a cop
havent seen him for years thats the truth
ganz and billy got my girl rosalie
he  he wants me to help him skip town
what am i wanted for
i dont think your guns loaded
hey youre right
im all wet
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b id just poured him then i tried to deck the sucker
then i sit back and i think i mean whos to say im not a dumb bitch  i work in a bar right i cant read a list of my academic credentials to every boozehound that comes in the place you are what you do
arent you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems ill take brutal indifference
tell meim dyin to hear it
you know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning
maybe you ought to buy me one
thats a fairly crummy way to start a morning
maybe that makes a nice excuse
when you start with that attitude its like i dont know who you are
you know something jack you really are hopeless
call me later
thanks for the coffee
great place for lunch
yeah guess it must have been a slow news day
look spare me the macho bullshit about your gun
look jack if you make everything your personal responsibility youll turn into a bad cop  its not a practical way to function
here it comes again  the sacred job
just one  some lady called  said shes a little hotheaded sometimes but she still wants her occasional roommate shed like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight if its humanly possible
listen goddamn it if you think im happy about it youre nuts i just gotta take care of a few things okay
im at work asshole  where else
no wonder youre so popular
the number  whats the goddamn number
elaine i gotta put you on hold

i can see that  pardon me for saying so but you look like shit  what happened
you real down
nothing  no sign of ganz  no sign of the indian  airports clean  train station bus station  docks shit
how do you know
what makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions  i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian  now if this indians girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be shes still vulnerable to him
when a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible
whaddya think
howd they take it back at headquarters
ive been waiting a long time to hear you say that
three more hours
promised id turn my back while he ah never mind
youre impossible
who the hell are you
im not so sure i can say the same thingyou dont look like a cop

personally they are of no interest to me id rather sell weaponsbut i have a customer so tell me
why  whats wrong with me
would you like a drink
look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden notice how each one is useful what a lovely ballet so full of form and color  so full oflife
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life  so in reality you and i are in the same business
you are a monster zorg
excuse me im looking for a priest
shes not my bride shes my fare shes looking for this vito cornelius according to the phone guide he lives here

and you dont know how they open is that what you are saying
imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are because it is evil total evil
your theory is interesting father but i dont think we have time to go into it right now
we have fortyeight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
is there anything that can stop it
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
did you see thatthingswallow our battleship like a gum drop  you cant even tell me what it is i ask you for options you give me bullshit give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards

 sorry
you got the guts tough guy  gonna kill us all is that it
what can i do for you mr welles
alright tom
there are reasons for the way we do things here
few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife  what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe  they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city  nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone  not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself  thats the last they saw her  the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch  they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright
i figured you share information
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive
this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved  theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run molestation whatever  besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal
theyre putting themselves in place of this kids parents and thinking theyd want to hear their girls okay even if thats all they hear
they were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance  we try to keep the children and adults separate no eating or smoking in here but theres a coffee machine in the hall
its horrible but itll be your best friend after a few days  i hope you realize what kind of long shot youre chasing after
celebrity films
yeah whos this
what
who is this
what the fuck are you 
whats he talking about
im gonna kill you
dont ask questions
starting to recognize a pattern
who is machine
i want his name
i will never get tired of hurting you eddie so you might want to change your attitude
okay well come back to that  so six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it  its longdale looking for a snuff film and you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up
told him you could get him a snuff film
how much did he pay you
thats all  thirty each  thats all it took for you to murder her
so you brought dino in and he brought machine  and one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models  and she never walked out
what did you do knock her out shoot her up 
i want to know  i want to know exactly what you did to her
show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it
i dont know  i felt like it  i never saw anyone get done before
made me sick but what did i care what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that  it was just something i was doing for money
what do you want to know  you saw it you saw the loop
there wasnt nobody around  this place was a shithole  i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries  dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and machine went to work
took it out the bathroom window buried it in the woods
keep moving
you cant go to the cops  all you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing
you got absolute zero
i dont know   out there somewhere
do it
do it  put me out of my misery so i dont have to listen to you whining anymore  you think its so easy
i never killed anyone
you know how my tapes sell  people eat this stuff up
maybe theres something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ever think of that
look you cocksucker
yes i do have something to say  i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you
as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
you are a private investigator
you were the middleman am i right old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
so he sent you gave you the money his errandboy  and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film  thats the beauty of lawyerclient privilege
must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything  wouldve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money
thats why you got scared when mrs christian hired me  you knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe  howd you find me
followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies
except youre willing commit murder with them
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right wanted them to find you one  well they didnt find you one longdale they went out and made you one
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered
youre making me very angry
youre asking me why
a man like mr christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain
isnt it incredibly obvious
you almost went over your limit
give me the film
give me the film
hes lying
big date tonight

what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend  were talking about stuff where people get hurt  specialty product
theres two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal  foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she males hemaphrodites its beyond hardcore but legal  this is the kind of hardcore where one guys going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love  now with some of the sm and bondage films they straddle the line  how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not  step over that line youre into kiddie porn  rape films but there arent many  ive never seen one
i heard you asking  that guy wasnt yanking you around  theres no such thing
how old are you
where are your parents
i dont mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
youre telling me it doesnt get to you
what about me
a daughter
dino velvet yeah hes like the john luc godard of sm flicks supposed to be a real weirdo
his stuff comes out of new york bondage and fetish videos gothic hardcore  definitely not for the squeamish
youre learning
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look  hell also do commissions for enough money
alright i get the picture
well im in new york now  what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand
take a vacation  ill pay you four hundred a day plus expenses
consider it  meanwhile dig up whatever dino velvet films you can get receipts  ill call back
you didnt say it was gonna be this luxurious
oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag
wha 
who is he
who is he his name
you dont need to be here
i know if i had to pick itd be choke or devil
whats next
still dont want to tell me what youre doing
whats this
look thats awful generous and everything
mister welles youre very prompt
uh huh pleasure
have a pleasant evening  will you have tea mister welles
hes odd
ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey  asking about you  i must say you have friends in influential places
as you know my husband passed away recently  two weeks ago now
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma  a terrible terrible dilemma
pittsburgh
he succeeded
do you carry a gun mr welles
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe  i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business  not till now that is
there was nothing he could do  my husband left everything to me  i prevented anyone from seeing the contents  i felt these were my husbands private things  i didnt i didnt realize
its a film of a girl being murdered
i didnt know what to think  i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband  to know that he watched this this atrocity  but i cant go to the police
please believe me  this is probably a stag film  simulated rape  hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play
im sure it is  its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke  more than likely he never even watched it
you you need to go to the police
you dont have any other choice
it wont work like that
i deal in divorce cases  corporate investigations
nothing remotely like this
okay
im not positive this means anything
one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
hello 
do you think the film could have cost that much
okay
you told me to look so i looked
hello
how are you  having any luck
ive been ordered into bed  the doctor says ive gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment
nothing more than a bother  have you any news for me
ive got about five thousand left in cash but ill need another thirty if you approve
yes 
ive been hired as an independent contractor by the us resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit  if you have any time over the next few days id like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter
im sorry let me explain the rcmp is a support organization and archive not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington  im sure youve dealt with them before
what was the name  ive got it here somewhere
right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me  he didnt call
its very important you dont let this raise your expectations  its not going to effect any ongoing efforts  all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope
i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv
so she didnt leave a note  she never gave any indication where she might go before she left
she just seemed depressed 
what was she running from
if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask  your husband he committed suicide
september 4th 1993  about a year after mary disappeared
why do you think he did it
you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter  were there any indications of any sort of abuse
i didnt mean to
i had to ask  i apologize
people remember me from the news  can you drive me back now
i i shouldnt take anymore of your time  maybe we can finish tomorrow  ill call tomorrow
doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother  then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time  thats when you start going to church
are you religious
ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though
its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons  when kids run they almost always leave a note  its guilt they want to say goodbye
do you think the police did a good job
it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it  she might have wanted to tell you something
how how can you say that to me
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me
you were right  i didnt find anything  im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry
i think about it everyday  but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her
hello 
i remember  you just left
what are you talking about 
mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead
someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her
they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes
they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her
yes i remember mary
do you know what happened to her
what is this
her belongings
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time
your soninlaw dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day saw that woman every night  the specifics are in the report and information about the woman  its unpleasant i know  i apologize

dan  and hes taking alice with him  pretty good dive yvonne  youve been practicing
vomit
why dont you shut up and let her talk two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal
im not finished  i loved greta  a lot and if maybe just maybe someone or some thing killed her id like to hear about it
its okay
you too
i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor  i thought it was your father
how is he  
you could train someone else
what is it
my father  hes not  
what did you mean  im out
you trade school boys are all alike arent you  anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward
wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu  it just so happens im unotu a coward  physical or mental  and before id risk my fathers life
that may be  but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here
perhaps  but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards  im referring to war  uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all  being spiritually yellow
peace  the dignity of man  the destiny of the human spirit  show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot
unidentified flying objects
thats enough holloway  ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone  
however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward  and it happens youve got no choice  either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there 
theyre so remote  cold  beautiful the stars  but now  i wonder 
maybe  just maybe  when their ship doesnt return  theyll decide not to come here after all
i dont know
now dave old buddy you know youre exaggerating   what do you think of this husband of yours  on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer  but unfortunately in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself 
reef
at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home  now 
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he
one of the finest men and officers alive  a real hero  in the best sense of the word  in world war two  he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist  a real egghead dogooder and crackpot  ban the atom tests  junk the nuclear subs  spend the mili tary budgetfor peace
but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son  it broke his heart  then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father  captain neilsen resigned from the navy  oh he still keeps his hand in  playing around with projects like the lungfish  but it broke him all the same
cyclops
were stuck tight
youve got to let us try skipper 
you all wait here  im going inside take a look
how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up
i think youre right
yeah
i dont hear anything  maybe youve been down here too long  why dont you go back up and 
hey  you know somethin  its getting lighter in here
and if i didnt uknowu better  id swear we were moving
you hear that
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from
wonder where powell and carney are
well
here  keep these  it wants me to come alone
dave  
get ready  we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard
is there any way out of it
what about down
course and speed
a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo
what course skipper
you better take powell and carney with you 
with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable  take sidearms and flare pistols 
excuse me skipper
skipper  could you take a look here
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
were dead in the water  but it indicates were moving
we read you  go ahead doctor  theyre inside the saucer  its filled with breathable air
now they feel itdown below
excuse me captain  there may be one last desperate chance  a oneinathousand shot
its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm  so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole
it doesnt seem possible but  could it be an electrical storm center  
above murmansk and finland
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear  but suppose it isnt at all  what if its umagneticu
in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it  recharging his batteries
the radiation level  from the saucer  its rising
as we near the pole
all ready
thought you were going to washington skipper
im  afraid i have some bad news for you reef   youll have to share quarters this trip
doctor neilsen  when did uthatu happen
what do you think
determine extent of damage immediately
youre sure its cyclops
whats the running time
right uatu him
but  what can we accomplish
a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast
suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops
straight to the pole  at almost fifty knots
whats the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole
remove your weapons commander and come here  alone
thats a ufaceu
my mission is to study various solar systems and planets  select the most suitable for colonization 
swell
he did
why not me  what am i  the closing act
why
it is a living thing  when damaged  you would say wounded  it immediately heals itself
to navigate wont you have to see your way
my yeoman will show you to your quarters
see what
well ill be  
just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer  cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus
you plotted the course of cyclops  then thats uouru course  wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him
weve asked ourselves that  over and over  a thousand times
due north  at five knotsno six
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks
you got yourself a computer alma

mrs gordon thank you

im not finding fault its a good idea good for you good for the town real modern too
marg

the other guy
cb little while ago one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers i figured youd know what really happened the fucking guy kill himself this twombley who the fuck is he anyhow
jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich
wade i got a message for you  jack hewitt hes looking for you wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in town hall
well i guess  thats what he said
rolfe

what was that  you got something to say say it say it
jesus pop how can you stand the cold dressed like that wheres ma
you remember margie fogg
how you and ma doing havent seen you in town for a while

rolfe
yeah brother look i was calling cause  has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley evan twombley
yeah i know him  the kid that was with him maybe you do too jack hewitt he works for lariviere with me hes my best friend
itll come out jack lied and the kidll get hung for it
who
no shit
well it was an accident
lillian was here in lawford
the night before the shooting
picked up jill she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween she wanted to go home
jill i was thinking of getting a lawyer maybe you can help me
dont think about it youre exhausted
get some sleep
havent you already done a bit of that
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess
anyone else want one rolfe
what about margie
well do you still plan to get married
i want to let the gas run out i dont want the bastard driving drunk and hes always drunk now after well hide the keys
i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
find them everywhere 
which is
then who shot him
motive you gotta have a motive
whod pay him that kind of money not the mob they got their own guys specialists
i dont know you tell me
yeah the guy with the bmw i told you about i did didnt i
so mel gordon wouldnt want a professional hit thatd make the feds dig deeper he wants an accident
its too neat things aint that neat it makes me mad that somebody can pay to kill somebody his own fatherinlaw and not be punished for it dont that piss you off
rights right goddamnit dont you care whats right
i was thinking about that story you told me about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after
i hate to disappoint you but i dont think it happened
it may have happened but not the way you said
it wasnt me i wasnt there but i heard about it when i heard about it it was about elbourne
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop i was a careful child and i became a careful adult but at least i wasnt afflicted by that mans violence
then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you dont know who the hell it belongs to strange its the business with the old man i know and how incredibly pissed i was at him and also chasing jack hewitt like that and the goddamned truck going through the ice not to mention margies being so upset  one thing on top of another
i know what it means im just running out of ways to use it
to help jack of course  and to nail those sonsofbitches the two gordons thats what alma calls them jesus rolfe whose side are you on
its not like he hasnt made us wait a few times
you dont want to say hi to your father
hey joey how bout a cocoa double whip cream
mom just this once give it a rest
well talk at home  you know most girls arent as lucky as you  for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime
hes in a meeting  he cant be disturbed
when i write my memoirs i think ill devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one
i know  but lotsa times i feel like its me versus the world  some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh  i mean it doesnt take a genius to figure which is more important
youre right and ill tell you a secret  i know exactly how you feel
mom

they had months in quarantine to develop the plan  porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug  hubley manufactured it  at the refinery  strader through the nightclub established a distribution network  and harcourt
okay george  we gotta play this real smart
uh george
george uh youre gonna break his little chest bones
george cmon  lighten up  its a beauty of a case  dont sweat it  we got him by the short hairs he aint gonna make any more of the shit

with harcourt and kipling dead i assume you will be requesting reassignment now
whats this about george  i know that look
no  we must do this alone
what is this
harcourt is dead
i never thought id say this but  for once in my life i think im willing to wait for backup
why the hell are you so dead set against backup
but theres no more drug

casull 454 magnum  youre talking twice the impact energy of 44 magnum hot loads
yeah the shells are too big for six in an cylinder  hell matt you dont need but one
mr hubley was an all right guy  and a damn good manager  the men liked him  im really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes
you think this is the guy who did it
to be honest its hard to say  i hate to admit it but  they all still kinda look alike to me
wait  you know who it looks like yeah  anderson  uh james anderson  he isnt in today  he took the afternoon off
that where anderson worked
dont piss him off oneal  when he gets like this i cant control him ive seen this before  he got like this once  i saw him jerk a guys spine out and show it to him nothing i could do  i hadda go throw up
heres hubley  left quarantine on november thirtieth relocated first to riverside then moved to los angeles early in february the following year  field of expertise chemical manufacturing  looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery
released december one  he and his wife moved first to modesto then coalinga california  wherever that is  settled in la in april  field of expertise organic chemical engineering  he and his wife have one child a son
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing

yeah i heard of it
you know ive been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning
yeah right  dont push your luck anyway according to the sheet the guy you nailed outside by the car

im paying people just to wait for you its ridiculous
oh yes and whats so intelligent about writing a requiem
youre mad shes mad wolfi
i see that youre expecting
when may i ask
what is ridiculous wolfi has many admirers in vienna they love him here people send us gifts all the time
and so you do the only time you come out is to eat
oh now im a bad housekeeper
be careful
hes adorable
behold
hey
behold
let us pass please let us pass at once were with the emperor
do you know who i am  this is my daughter i am frau weber we are favoured guests
i am sorry madame but no i cannot let anyone pass
upstairs
ive heard about you for ages i thought you must be an old man
its such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart and for gertrude
i said play
what a strange young man
really
perhaps a little refreshment first a little coffee or a little chocolate
just one year
i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna majesty it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure  if that is your majestys intention
what a charming idea may i see
may i try it
delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in
aflat majesty
and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri
my pleasure
well im glad to hear that
good morning court composer this is my niece the princess elizabeth
oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
an interesting idea majesty but 
you already commissioned an opera from mozart
yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
im sure there is a way majesty some kind of a little contest i could perhaps put together a small committee and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majestys wishes
sire
i dont think you understand me court composer
why not
majesty i dont like to talk against a fellow musician
i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
as a matter of fact one of my own pupils  a very young singer  told me she was  er  well
do you like this salieri
your majesty
oh thank you
and now he has returned the compliment herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you
majesty
why so
well what is it about tell us the story
yes where
keep it sire if you want to it is already here in my head
it is new it is isnt it sire
and german
so then you like it you really like it your majesty
what do you mean sire
i dont understand there are just as many notes majesty as are required neither more nor less
my dear young man dont take it too hard your work is ingenious its quality work and there are simply too many notes thats all cut a few and it will be perfect
majesty this is madame weber she is my landlady
really how delightful may i ask when you marry
excuse me but how old are you
bravo mozart most charming yes indeed clever man
majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour
may i introduce my father he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg he would so much like to kiss your hand it would make his whole stay so memorable for him
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
it is not your place to ask questions is it true
would you tell me why
mozart i am a tolerant man i do not censor things lightly when i do i have good reason figaro is a bad play it stirs up hatred between the classes in france it has caused nothing but bitterness my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people i do not wish to see the same fears starting here
but majesty this is just a frolic its a piece about love
but its new its entirely new its so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act  it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly  a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener  quartet becomes quintet and so on  on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that
guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
forgive me majesty im a vulgar man but i assure you my music is not
ahha well then we should make some effort to acquire him we could use a good german composer in vienna surely
ahha what do you say chamberlain
yes sir
well what do you have for me today
yes what about him
i write to you with urgent news i am coming to vienna take no further steps toward marriage until we meet you are too gullible to see your own danger as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours do as i bid and await my coming
why are you here
feed well of course she feeds me she stuffs me like a goose all day long shes the best cook in the world i mean since mama just wait youll see
do you always live like this
shes very tired poor creature you know me im a real pig its not so easy cleaning up after me
oh we could if we wanted to but stanzi wont hear of it she wants to do everything herself
it couldnt be better
what do you mean its wonderful really its  its marvelous people love me here
who who says that now thats a malicious lie
pupils
yes
i dont know its not important i mean i dont want pupils they get in the way ive got to have time for composition
whats that
why not
you dont have secrets from me
isnt that marvelous were delighted
thank you thatll be fine dont spend any money on me
no really
yes papa name it name it ill do anything you say
im tired of this game please play without me
papa is this your idea
are you playing a trick on me
never mind you wont have to do anything for me ever again im leaving
dont worry im not staying here to be a burden
father

c major sopranos and altos in thirds altos on c sopranos above  voca voca me voca me cum bene dictis

and thats it do you have it
do you have it
do you want to rest a bit
well stop for just a moment then well do the lacrimosa
would you stay with me while i sleep a little
i am so ashamed
oh have i seen it
you mean in turkey
then why especially does it have to be in german
what you think mozart is scarcely the point it is what his majesty thinks that counts
that will do herr mozart
mozart herr mozart may i have a word with you please right away
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
exactly a dance
what are you doing herr director
can we see the scene with the music back please
what is this herr chamberlain
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
is the emperor angry with me
then why doesnt he simply appoint me to the post
no but im the best
who is on this committee
naturally the italians of course always the italians
they hate my music it terrifies them the only sound italians understand is banality tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to resurrection  baba baba baba baba anything else is morbid
show them one interesting modulation and they faint ohime morbidezza morbidezza italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music
herr mozart 
i dont think it was really decided director
my dear fellow the language is not finally the point do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre
well done mozart really quite fine
mozart 
mozart music is not the issue here no one doubts your talent it is your judgment of literature thats in question even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce why waste your spirit on such rubbish  surely you can choose more elevated themes
what do you want
about what
so
what do you want
leave me alone
do you know who i am you never heard of me did you
are they
i do not seek forgiveness
how well are you trained in music
where
i cant say i do what is it
well
oh i know that thats charming  i didnt know you wrote that
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
all vienna has heard that
is it true
do you hear me
it was incomprehensible what was god up to here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve gods gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions  even though engaged to be married  and no rebuke at all was it possible i was being tested was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful that was very possible all the same why him why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts i couldnt stop them
yes father yes so much for my vow of chastity what did it matter good patient hardworking chaste  what did it matter had goodness made me a good composer i realized it absolutely then  that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art and i was nothing to god
no was mozart a good man
all i ever wanted was to sing to him thats his doing isnt it he gave me that longing  then made me mute why tell me that if he didnt want me to serve him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent go on tell me speak for him
oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me
what
yes
why why why why add to your misery by confessing to murder you didnt kill him
no you didnt
but not his body
my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer is that your penance is it
oh my son my poor son
ive just learned something that might be of interest to you herr director
mozart is writing a new opera an italian opera
you mean that play
hes setting that play to music
are you absolutely sure
where
well mozart is already rehearsing
what anger
ballet what ballet
yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro
bravo your majesty
well actually sire if you remember we did finally incline to italian
i know we banned this play but frankly i cant remember why can you refresh my memory herr director
oh yes yes and that was
here i am my angel
ive taken pity on you my angel i heard your wish
now youve got to promise me faithfully youll remain true to me forever then youll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you
well promise then
well i dont know i mean youre a delicious delightful delectable little bird but dont you think you might be just a little tough
this is embarrassing you know you introduced mozart to some of my friends and hes begging from practically all of them it has to stop
cant you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ive done my best i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts he got a fee  what i could afford cant you think of anyone who might do something for him
how sad its tragic isnt it such a talent
excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
she didnt say but she says its urgent
that lady is back sir
what does he want
herr salieri
can we come in
but hes all right
well tell him we were here wont you

how are you protecting your depositors by making a lot of idiotic loans
you know dickson as well as we do hell shut the doors before he gives up control
say you know i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball youve got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out its the only way you can hit anything
whats the matter with my policy how many losses has this bank taken in the last twentyfive years  ill tell you not a single one  whats wrong with that kind of banking
character hmmpf thats your idea
most of the creditors i know personally ive seen them grow up in the community i knew their fathers and mothers before them
im running this bank my way get that clear
we want to talk to you
well be forced to shut the doors ive worked twentyfive years night and day to keep this bank alive youve all made money out of it are you willing to help
i know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city get that money over here and ill stop this run within five minutes
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you you thought they were your friends why dont you go out there now and try and get some help from them
no you cant reason with anyone else when youre in a jam we pleaded with you to keep liquid but you wouldnt listen to us you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish now you want our help you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that youve wrecked all right theres one way you can get it give us an option on your stock and resign as president
say you cant do that
dickson id like to talk to you about the bank
come out here you pawnbrokers  take a look at this
i hope you dont mind me asking you a few questions mr cluett

looks like youre going to have no trouble at all what was the ladys name mr cluett
oh
thanks
stand back inspector or ill shoot drop that gun
dont be a fool cluett this is only going to make it worse for you
what were you doing at finlays this morning

i didnt kill him i had nothing to do with that i tell you i was home in my apartment last night  i can prove it

but dude listen  couldnt we make this some other time
this wont do not during business hours

no jimmy has a point the youngerjames gang could be confusing
we got a problem here brother
thats what the newspapers say werent for jesse james this gang wouldnt be able to find a goats ass with a stick
this is the best score yet
that was because of the reputation the gang had
cole were outlaws not exactly the most respectable job if you know what i mean
howd they 
i aint done 
bob i didnt
i swear 
im sorry cole
things changed when you quit the gang for example im now the one who says lets ride

jesus mercy thats charlie higgins dave laller 
cole i want to get to the farm make sure little jim and the girls are okay
they came up made the same offer they made you folks our little brother jim tried to chase em off one of those detectives hit him in the head knocked him out cole lost his temper
damn
the army can hang him
home we go home we ride like hell to get there and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes and when we get there we stay there and god help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again
how many of them did he kill
you have no shame
but if we take their money and supplies
all right settle down all this money aint ours
the outlaws calling themselves the jamesyounger gang shot their way out of town wounding the sherriff and three other townsfolk
okay folks i think we know how this is going to go

this isnt a feud this is war theyve got more men than we do we kill detectives they can replace em in a day
ill pick the first job i mean i know a girl down at the bank see if she cant get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money
the jamesyounger gang
i got seven thousand
see franks being smart about this
its not a bank
the fidelity bank and trust was robbed on tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men
jesse we got to have a word
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the jamesyounger gang
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity
itll be the biggest score yet

and almost got hanged in peacetime
im the better soldier jesse
still smells fishy
fine we hit this bank

i think one of ems glass
oh lord the dance hall girl at buntys
i have no idea what you just said but it sounded real nice
bastards come back here and face me
hey we decide something thats it were in this for the long haul and this idea of me and jesses will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin up on us in our sleep weve got to think 
jesse

you know youre welcome any time
daddy dont start with this again
hes going to be fine right daddy
theyre gone what are you 
well i hope the boy pulls through we should know in the morning
he thinks this is some kind of game
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling they try to shoot it off
distracting enough for you
so youre saying i could have done more to attract their attention
such as
that would have made an impression
see thats your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff im already finished doing it
webs dead
hell of a war
hello liberty missoura
looks like web mimms wasnt the only casualty this towns got
frank dont you have something to say
whyyyy he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself
all we thought about was coming home i swore id kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay fine by me
that just might work
big and older
you are a charmer
shes still talking to jesus
 if you stop saying things about my zee
you know him
i went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed the railroad doesnt even need our land theyre just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming
youre looking a bit more spry now that somebody 
pinkertons its the railroad
 we could move on rebuild make a decent life someplace else
didnt think you would  im going to go make the coffin
howd it go in there
and i planned getting you off the hangmans deck 
and its guarded by pinkerton detectives
i dont think its counterfeit do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare
gents we are in the middle of something here
pardon the delay folks but we had to get mad bob younger under control
this has been a good year
and were good at it
youve killed your fair share of men
thats a lie you couldve bought a dozen farms with the money weve stolen
were doing this for ma
what do you want me to say frank i was killing men when i was fifteen i like getting shot at i like riding out of town with a posse at my back this is a helluva better life than farming
were drunk
you taking sides against me now frank
theyre all pinned down cant even get to the door
shoulda learned with web made it look fun made it look like an adventure got web killed now jim
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west how was he supposed to say no to that
youre a pisspoor liar for the smartest man i know
a war against the railroad what the hell were we thinking
ill meet you down there in a few weeks
yknow uncle frank
every time you tell that story you stop there thats not how it ended i was five when my dad got shot
allow a man his version of the past when you get to be my age youve got enough painful memories youre allowed to soften a few of the edges up
that he was
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
cant argue that
uncle frank
how much of that story is true
did you kill yankees
ma im glad to see you being nice to our injun friend
easterners
the lord says we can bury em out back in the orchard nobodyll ever find them
ma please
riders 
doc mimms will 
zerelda little zee mimms
but still died
jesse are you awake
jesse is that your hand
you shouldnt be up
youre sick of my company
teasing you is completely unfair
i shouldnt tease a hero
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole were all so proud of you jesse and not a single farms been sold to the railroad since youre everybodys hero
so youre saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger
i used to come to this tree when i was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when i got older
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
arr hand over your jewels missy
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
not if i find the right girl
smart funny bossy always makes me think shes two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
ahem from this doctrine no ah from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still like  shiny sparkling rocks
little ones
yep
i am so sorry jesse
you and i weve started something you know  i dont know whatll happen if you do this
let the law 
whose justice yours or gods  when will you stop
zee
i dont understand
thats wonderful its just i thought
i would never have imagined us in a place like this
are you going to be happy here mr james without all that excitement
hmm
i beg your pardon
let me see that
now sweetie yall wouldnt go believing one of them silly dime novels would you
aw shucks maam
dont turn around
you get arrested again ill kill you
i cant believe i had to blow up a train for you
dont swear
tennessee
were moving you tomorrow
oh its a similar room but the hotel is in washington dc youre not going to get a fair trial down here in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers
did you order our houses burned down
you almost ended my career before it began
how did you spot the ambush in torrell
mmm
yes
almost got me in billings i saw you there shooting at me
oh thats nice to know  were going to hang you you know
was it worth it
thats what i would have done
you cocky little bastard
that was for my ma now this is for everybody else
the railroad has no business in tennessee therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee
id just as soon kill you jesse james but chasing you takes up too much of my time
this is unusual most of our marriages are members of the congregation
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable  jesse woodson james jesse james the jesse james
discretion sir i am a man of the cloth
now lets have a drink
and youre too young
i like that
you okay jesse
not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
jim you been with a girl yet
well not exactly
hell yeah i been with  uh not exactly its just i dont want to get one of these paid ladies you know
you and frank and cole and even bob get all these girls because youre good looking and famous you dont have to pay they just look at me like im the baby brother  dont tell anyone okay jesse
tell you something else  i cant drink that good neither im going to go outside and throw up
what about that rock island bastard
 too young for whisky
jesse you explain to lyla my girl you know from that time
why yeah
oh you were talking to jesse
really
not at all
thank you miss  
gosh thats a pretty name buy you a drink
why dont we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
devereux my brother cole dated a european girl once
well this land is about to be condemned
relax alan the army has this all in hand and mr thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate
my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
how can that be
theres only four of them
mr thaddeus rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field
really
parker tell me whats going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars not necessarily in that order
good
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers
just perfect
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool i see a power void to be filled as we have the most power we may move with impunity
they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards killing several of them then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile
thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track 
to be precise they didnt blow up the tracks
your men knew the risks
with my money
the final route for the railroad is complete
parker
what is that
that
this is him
how did you know
look at this pinkerton they got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least
you wouldnt have done that
i want them arrested and hanged
this is no game
a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st louis missouri the brave and daring jamesyounger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west
the gang made off with thirtyfive thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land  who wrote this ill see him hanged every tuesday for a month
its early in the game yet mr rains jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves feeling out each others patterns
hardly farmers ive done some checking all these were in the war these men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them they are disciplined welltrained and have a charismatic leader if i were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what i would create
pinkerton its been eight months i see robberies i see hold ups but i do not see men on the end of nooses
first of all you shut up  now youve given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover every time the james gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area but theres just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in this gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs
yes thats the way to win the locals back to our side
no you demand results they are not the same thing and if you want results you will let me do my job as i see fit unless of course  you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it
so hes won
every three months the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty missouri they always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
what the hell is that sound
listen what are you doing tonight
listen youre dating luis hes in arizona youre fucking me and we havent made plans what could you possibly be up to tonight

how old are you
where did you go to school
your address
nice very nice
pardon me but are you okay
bad habit
would you rather i not smoke
you sure
what can you tell me about paul owen
how well did you know him
yeahyale thing
sotheres nothing you can tell me about paul owen
what kind of man was he besides  the information youve just given
do you feel that way
where did paul hang out
yeah you knowhang out
he had a yacht
dont you know this
anything else you can tell me about owen
so was i
well theres a message on his answering machine saying he went to london
his girlfriend doesnt think so
actually yes
well ive had a hard time getting an actual verification a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but i checked it out and what happened is he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul so
was he involved at all  do you think in occultism or satan worship
i know it sounds like a lame question but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question but last monthi dont know if youve heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
have you consulted a psychic
had his apartment been burglarized
i mean no ones dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right
thats so typical isnt it
nothing
the earth just opens up and swallows people 
youll have to excuse me i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes
uh no theres onedown here
listen if anything occurs to you any information at all
detective kendalluh campbell kimball kimball  call me don

yeah no finlandia as usual fucking dump
i mean they want to get caught
i actually came to see timothy price but hes taken a leave of absence
do you remember where you were on the night of pauls disappearance  which was on the twentieth of december
i had a date with a girl named veronica
what
welliwaitwhat information have you received
well i could he wrong
well thank you mr bateman
listen im a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when ive sorted out all this information
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owens disappearance it would make my job a lot easier
never i meani dont really like singers
no i like music justtheyrehueys too black sounding for me
no hash browns
buteveryone orders the hash browns here i mean itshave you been here before
so the night he disappeared any new thoughts on what you did
i think maybe youve got your dates mixed up
according to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner withmarcus halberstam
ive questioned him
yes and he denies it though at first he couldnt be sure
yes
he does youre sure
oh kimball now where were you 
he wasnt with paul owen
oh right of coursewe had wanted paul owen to come but he said he had plansi guess i had dinner with victoriathe following night
im so hungry
im so hungry
i lost my job

evelyn great ass goes out with that loser patrick bateman what a dork
paul give me your amex card good boy bateman slaps the card down looks at the check
no man im gonna bail
you like huey lewis and the news
hey halberstam
why are there copies of the style section all over the place do you have a dog a chow or something
is that a raincoat
you think so
how can he lie like that how can he pull that shit
i just dont see how someone anyone can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit how can you be so fucking i dont know cool about it
is it over
you are a fanatic
alice you gotta make him do the startup with teddy and me
im just screwed
you dont wanna move do you
i cant help it i feel like theyd do anything to keep their 
i think i kind of lost it i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful didnt know i even cared about that stuff
a lot of what larry says is true they just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they 
its important
when i was a kid and he was moving us all over the place i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 10 i thought gary boyd was the greatest
if my dadd leveled with me like that even once the weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary its his fantasy too
but
i forgot thats why you have to help me decide
cmon i wouldnt have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating 
whens brian coming for the tv
that took some fun out of 
you know hes never been anybodys counselor before
to our new life  whats wrong
its the way he said it just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie thats how you knew you were onto something ugly
hes your boss hes not your 
if you cant deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
i mean if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much 
what
whatre you  what
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death nelson said it was an airtight case
i cant see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
they hack into peoples programs
it isnt a broadcast studio its  a surveillance post or something thats why they have the dishes on top
go where you cant get away from people like this
you think i dont know that
how should i know solving a problem i guess or needing to control everything i dont know  ive gotta get in there
its the only one with dishes on the roof the studios a front thats why they keep postponing its opening  gotta get in there
i cant just walk away
they stop the construction work at six or seven the parking lots mostly clear by two or three in the morning even the early geeks dont get there before five
i know how to get in there but youve gotta help me
its almost nine ive been so worried  what did you see in there
its what they said it is an unfinished broadcast studio you were right i just drove to seattle and back
the justice department guy who came to the apartment when 
after i broke into 21  which was insane thank god they didnt catch me  i just drove around trying to figure out what possessed me you know what ive been putting my own guilt on gary
if id stayed down there maybe this wouldntve happened
that was  different
where were you  you know you cant keep anything from me
look at this
why doesnt he ask us to his party hes never even met you
its for the museum he knows youre a painter if anybody should be invited 
i know you think im too attached to him but still i am close to gary and youre the most meaningful person in my life  im going back to the comix place why should i be killing myself
are you gonna tell me where you went
no no i sent an email to somebody just now to tell her how i feel about you  you know im clueless without you you know i 
great
you look beautiful
what
milo
here we go
wanna savor this
right wait a toast
didnt mention he was going to the justice department
not like him is it to do a thing like that without telling you youre not losing your hold on him are you
thatll be a test wont it
lisas an extremely valuable member of the skywire team weve got our eyes on her you keep yours on milo
he said it made sense that garys code was like teddys that that clich about great minds was true said it was all about his own guilt  plus he has a tendency to get gary mixedup with his dad once in a while it always passes
dont worry milo im here as a friend or maybe a supplicant
beggar were at a disadvantage with outpost our experts arent as smart as theirs sometimes we cant tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights im taking a shot in the dark here i can offer you 32000 a year a buick im hoping youve got a feeling its the right thing to do
mr barton do you remember me
yes sir i need to talk to you
milo
what seems to be the problem you look a little upset
milo
my goodness
if theres a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
let me look into it see whats being done frankly its not my area
and outpost youre happy there
youre living here
well i parked illegally see ylater
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software youd be my partner
will i get to work for outpost
what
okay
what
youre interfaced with our dish
is it your software
what
when did you know
thats gotta kill him right
conglomeratesre lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites theyll pay him a huge premium to get online
theres no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems tove vanished
stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
milo surprised hes not your guest
milo im danny
couldnt convince teddy to come
we could move em up here
whos that
hello
cool
you know a lot about art i guess
ive only shown this to three other people i bought 200 weve launched 12 so far i keep the coordinates in this room  its left over from sdi reagans star wars technology they orbit 426 miles up
among other things we know convergence is the real superhighway all the pcs tvs phones etc linked together why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky
the content filer has tbe written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms really omniplatforms including whatever new hardware emerges
when you get to a certain age you start wondering about your legacy i doubt you even remember outpost 10 
no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
think i should buy some originals
somebody said im just another philistine with reproductions
could work with a new switch there may be a few more things hidden
hows it going
its okay really
you did this  overnight
milo whats up
you really wrote this just today
everything i do is under scrutiny the questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid  im confused doesnt everybody in business try to get ahead
it scales dont you think
i heard what happened
had you talked to him much lately
did you
i meant did you find other stuff to 
youve been coming in early
wow you must have 20000 lines of code there
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler and it came over me its in the wrong place
gary hi
im okay its going well
why did you move around so much when you were a kid
no i just went deeper into the machine preferred being the geek to having to explain lying wouldve been worse
cause he was a liar and i hated him  get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world the more he mocked me the deeper i went cause if being savvy meant being like him   guess thats why im kind of clueless even now didnt cultivate my conniving side not sure i even have one
thats great thanks
dear lisa ive enjoyed working with you id be lying if i didnt say i find you attractive but in my heart i know that alice  you left my party to send email
you couldve handwritten it
gary i 
i hope you know what you mean to me not just because of what youre doing because of who you are
im pretty close but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer you know what its like writing software
this is good who did it
whatd the girl say
hasnt affected his work though
help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
okay 2
ready for number three
longitude 109 
what
gary
all the companies know the faculties tell em at the target schools
i think you should go
i know you lost all his work maybe i could come down here and 
just thought his work should go on
its only meaningful when youve got 40000 lines of code to back it up
your app kind of blew mine out of the water
you wanna work  here
you guysll be using teddys old space is that okay
could it be a glitch something the construction workers caused
every entry was authorized
whatre we looking for
delbert seems to enter 21 twice without leaving the first time
get the backslash the colon keys kids dont use but geeks do  what would milo want in here anyway
you calling phil and randy
come with me
now what are we doing i dont get any of this shit
lisa
you know mine
im getting a teachers pet rep
were you
me too were you an army brat or something
did i say something
whatve you got there
cool
did you wanna be alone
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps how fast are you going
mines not the ceo he barely remembers to take a shower
maybe once i rewrote it anyway
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then or now
thats great i  didnt know
i snuck into 21
you thought about it too youve been suspicious for a while but its not happening in there its happening in the day care
its easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell em they upload medical files school records pharmacy files theyd be happy just to steal code forever but when a program gets close to fruition like teddy he was almost there
i know why youre so secretive why you wont let anybody near you  i know what he did to you
is that my  scenario  tell me
hes out of prison
milo
i always felt if a  boy i liked ever found out  hed run hed think i was unclean
what about the fbi
who can we trust
do we post it on the net
the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
hes buying up pretty much everything cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives getting ready for skywire
yeah they dig stuff like this  cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of 2001
time
how close are you
we cant just assume theyre standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch id have to write in an aglet
its how online services push logos they wanna sell you you dont ask for em they just appear have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house and then the quality of the broadcast wouldnt exactly be digital thats 12 months away
youd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop maybe some audio too to tie it all in to gary how long would that take you
gary knows im close on skywire we have to do this fast
oh man id have to get into garys house to get the satellite positions
i dont know 
why were you so careless
why were you snooping in my office
think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
i told teddy about you
i felt guilty cause i owed so much to alice but even then i was starting to wonder is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you if you have a lucrative skill its all anybody wants from you you grow older but you dont grow up you turn into  into 
great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire were there
thank god
they know i broke in alice helped me  shrots not one of them hes blundering into this on his own
hardly anybody does thats the beauty part no cameras the doj doesnt bother with it its accessed by a tunnel they boast about you know the best place to hide a leaf
oh
same with the excerpts im choosing theyll play against any of the images you described
you could always say you have to go the bathroom
does he know you know
why
please dont go
meet me at the other location
they know i had no choice get out of the house now do you have a laptop
bring it to the other location
maybe its the satellite
he knows
latitude 47 degrees
you got my email
is that how larry feels
wanted to say goodbye to him
we rented a loft in sunnyvale  you know whats the bad part we cant talk about work anymore were competitors the venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms
but these like white supremacists trashed my office last week
theyre in the neighborhood they usually hassle vietnamese grocers
im cool they didnt touch the machine or my disks probably didnt know what they were so you a moonie yet  milo
what come on is it serious
did you tell alice
a beautiful geek i dont wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but whatre the chances
i dunno i guess larrys got me totally suspicious of that place
milo geeks dont have two girlfriends most dont have one
so  how far are we from the campus
so howd you like the house
every geek heres got a thing for lisa but thats about the biggest reaction shes had to anybody
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  youll be working with her
whatre they building
garys not into fiber optics hes betting everything on the satellites
we tried the big vaporware number gary its nosale
maybe hell get back to work
did you download corey in san jose
what is it
theres nothing in this hall someones pulling your chain as usual
that kids the great white hope
whore these guys
fellas im gonna have to ask you to leave here now
you seem surprised to see me
what and watch all my earnings go  down the toilet

oh my god hes back

commander i have to log it
but my design was perfect  your autonomic functions were shut down and even though your arm wasnt frozen the aging was retarded therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left
but dr evil all you need to do is  work with this tennis ball squeeze it for twenty minutes a day a few months of that and itll be just as strong as the other arm
we could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation processemdash
ahhhhhhhhh
weve got a lot of work to do
some of you i know some of you im meeting for the first time

fascinating what are your plans for this evening
and thats how you want to live your life is it

about your next assignment mrs peel 
ahem as i was saying perhaps another macaroon 
good luck  peter  emma
you
a slight miscalculation  my face was burned beyond recognition fortunately my research into plastics came in handy 
an unholy trinity 
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
of course i planned that too
you disappoint me emma  cant you guess  for you it was all for you

according to mother sir august owns half of the highlands a millionaire former head of special projects at the ministry now 
not so much eccentric more barking mad he has a wife called june and a daughter somewhere  julie
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
so  i distract him while you snoop around how
ah brenda   mrs peel
strange
i wasnt about to
mother and dr darling have me under observation they think i tried to kill you
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead
but thats absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but its not my style
thats possible sir august was convinced hed met me before but id never met him another odd thing when it rained he said it was just as someone had promised
an invitation to a formal picnic
i must say you look more your old self 
either way  may i ask why you dress in that fashion

the prospero project was started by my husband it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming in theory climate engineering is entirely feasible we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite a quick fix
exactly thered been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea propane gas mostly in small quantities it captures chlorine protects the ozone layer but it proved impractical too bulky 
thats what we were working on
three agents killed by bad weather
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather

let me tell you something martin swayzak is going to be this towns next mayor
why do you think marty came here tonight because he cares about your department you dont know how hard he works you dont know about his programs helping west side 
what was that oh man you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard
boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that
brian do you always have to be so stupid think about your future for once
look i didnt mean to take a piece out of you back there i just thought youd call when you came back you didnt and  dont blow it just because of this garbage between us
ive been thinking about what you said the other night if the offers still on the table id like to talk about it
arson
hey
boss and i are up to about three words an hour
i could use a date
hi
if you werent at least the 300th person to ask me that id probably be pissed  boy you sure know its a mans world sometimes
you think thats really any of your business
okay
no hes more of a dinosaur guys not a dummy though hes juggling alot of balls on this one
jesus give him a break there isnt enough proof yet to go public sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch em and weve maybe figured out why backdrafts but you cant rush this stuff not till its locked
thanks for the invite
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city lotta tradition locked up in here what do you think
see that trap door up there that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horsedrawn engines it was pretty different then but kinda the same yknow
when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman
well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment this area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose
brian whats wrong
i didnt know it was a secret there arent supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators 
will you please keep your voice down theres people 
i was doing my job
let me ask you something do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills who the hell are you kidding i was there remember i saw you and your brother 
oh yeah hes the real fireman  who are you just another probie working for swayzak 
hi
we still talking  look im sorry about the other day 
i dont know anything about it
do you know what youre asking me to do
yknow four years ago i was working in a bakery two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he didnt even know my name i run that office now marty believed in me and i believe in him you want me to just throw that away
what is 
im sorry
i think your boss is going to need some spin control
whatll you do
ill see ya around huh
brian mccaffrey  oh this is really a treat brian mccaffrey lost a dad to the animal huh
im close but i cant get who it is
okay heres the deal ill tell you a story you tell me one fair
your first question should be who isnt it isnt a spark brian not enough damage and an insurance pro wheres the profit margin
 no no your turn tell me a story
famous story even straight burn just an engine and truck first on scene what did you feel brian when you first got there
you gotta tell a story too brian its fair cmon dont think too hard 
right light smoke low roll couplea civilians hollering  medium deal so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape  mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across what were you feeling brian  cmon you promised be honest  okay guard
very good brian  about your report here the way to a torchs heart is through his tools thats how you know him its the way he talks to the fire and to you if you listen
thats a probie answer youre smarter than that brian
who the fuck is doing this
oh jesus christ
if it was a joke sir youd be laughing
i want another shot sir
if you remember sir my test scores were in the top 
i need another one sir
no it isnt out of your hands or you wouldnt even have met me if i push you have to let me back in dead hero father rule sir
uh im brian mccaffrey your new assistant
are you still here
then go find a corner i dont want you in my way
where are you going
 shhh
so you were happy here warm and cozy and in no hurry  soot high clean unburned wall low indicates slow burn in thermal balance  find me some glass
glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn explosion must of come after a slow burn  you little tease what were you up to you little bastard huh what made you that mad  or scared  it started in this room took its time hung out but the air ran out it couldnt breathe so it was snuffed but it wasnt dead still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air
temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire
uh i dont think thats in my contract
read
 go to the bottom under heat properties
son of a bitch tears em apart just to eat the oxygen wouldnt take much at all to melt ten gauge wire problems burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace  unless you could find something that would eat its residue
look it isnt proof okay someone may have put the chemical in the outlet but we found it as a vapor in cosgroves clothes
even if it was used to seal the air off that doesnt explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft a guns a helluva lot easier
i dont guess
thats it oh that son of a bitch hes different goddamn it you see what this tells us huh our killer doesnt love fire
i got it after we talked to ronald torches want to fry the whole goddamn world but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much  the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls and he made his burns backdrafts 
but he could have killed everybody there the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall the backdraft blew out the flame thats it thats the reason
why backdrafts whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out
no we have a stone killer trying to make a point
what the hell are you doing here
in a word brian what is this job all about
hey boss dekom trust is owned by pan illinois which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics which is a division of windy city ventures whos partners are  alan seagrave donald cosgrove and jeffrey holcomb
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants
nice bunch of guys
this is the copy of swayzaks manning report that was released everybody on this job knows its bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers theyre all airtight
ive got three different drafts of the same report  with different numbers thatre all over the place looks like they were just making it up as they went along
then who wrote the report
well brian i guess you can say its arson now
did you pull me out
did i say thanks
just wondering
so what do you want me to do
your brother was a good man
another couple of good men get burned up for their city is that how its going to read  youre the only one that knows
brian
bout written you off how long have you been in town
four months
thats sean jeez hes a giant
sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle
well thats two things to strangle stephen for where is he anyway
oh man im sorry
yeah big fan
uh i think theres been a mistake i didnt save that woman
no you dont understand i saved a mannequin
every little boys fantasy
i have a job
yeah we got all kinds of traditions  like dying young
mr mccaffrey
mr mccaffrey keeping busy
completely out of control
arent you even curious
howd you know these are supposed to be sealed
you crooked son of a bitch why 115
man something sure put a crimp in his evening
do you have to do that
yknow what stephen said to me right when all the shit was coming hard you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if youre just gonna do this job or be great at it
what
so you surviving without me
well if it isnt the littlest mccaffrey  hey you break anything with that you buy it  sorry there must be something wrong with my eyes i keep thinking thats a fire department uniform
really well lets have a look at what else was in your blood i always look forward to getting these they make such a nice collage for the bar assistant director sales aspen snowmobile tours
uh huh and pioneers pride mobile log cabins that was in your blood about six months wasnt it

father if it was so trivial so natural so  no i have sinned and you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition and to absolve me father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve god
i also thought of that bread father and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died and i kept the cool damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning  and my sin you see father 
those boys those sad raging boys they came to me as the needy do and like many of the needy they were rude like all the needy they took and like all the needy they needed  father i knew them they learn in our school and play in our schoolyard and they are good boys

good morning cheeba
delacroix
sloan and i have been looking all over for you
no offense
i have this concept for a tv pilot theres no guarantee it will get made but regardless youll still make some money
what kind of show is this gonna be
what about in the mean time  not the in between time
nice to meet you
gentlemen the show our show will be satirical  you know what that is dont you  trust me on this one
im starvin like marvin
hurry up i wanna watch hbo
ahh the luxuries of life
chill im the brains behind this outfit
yo you gotta show some patience you want me to snap my fingers and presto chango  youre an overnight sensation  son there is no such thing
we ran out without my shoes and the floor  i gotta get my stuff  what about our savings
we got evicted from our home weve both been on the streets for the last week
if its not too much trouble could you order us some food
that aint funny
manray sloan says youre too talented to be dancing on the street
my tap shoes
what do i have to do
how different
dela im aboard  as long as i get to hoof and get paid too
i would like to change your name
youre now mantan
i want you to start using the name mantan and not manray if you dont mind
mantan
im not playin myself no mo
i wont do it anymore
im always gonna be that  but i aint doing no more buck dancing
our guest today is pierre delacroix he is the creator of the highly controversial tv show mantan lets get right into it  you have been called by some in the community a traitor a sellout an uncle tom why does your show generate such feelings
no matter how sexist or racist the material may be
but the line has to be drawn
are you trying to excuse our holocaust
exactly thirtytwo minutes ago
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone
four minutes ago
do you know what cp time is
im sorry about my blowup but i have to have a whipping boy every meeting
i understand black culture  i grew up around black people all my life if the truth be told i probably know niggers better than you monsieur delacroix  please dont get offended by my use of the quoteunquote n word  i got a black wife and three biracial children so i feel i have a right to use that word  i dont give a damn what spike says tarantino is right  nigger is just a word  if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i
the material youve been creating is too white bread  white people with black faces  the huxtables cosby revolutionary  but thats dead  we cant go down that road again
the middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave  the middle class black family moves into a small southern town that is run by the kkk  the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter  the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter  the middle class single black mother raises her teenage son  and so on and so forth  its too clean too antiseptic
delacroix wake up brother man the reason why they didnt get picked up was because nobody  and i mean nobody  niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk
you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways  brother man im blacker than you  im keepin it real and youre frontin trying to be white
thats exactly what i think  i want you to create something that people want to see  lets be honest the majority of the people in the country are deaf dumb and blind and im including 35 million africanamericans  you know and i know niggers set the trend set the styles  this is a golden opportunity now  these idiots have to be led to the water
what is it you want from me  some plantation follies  some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch  some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads  you want me to go back to the ante bellum days
delacroix im glad you got your mind right
were all happy to be here and im going to paint a picture for you
ive done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right  in my previous work its been all surface superficial  i have never really dug deep  not anymore  as mark twain fully understood satire is the way  race has always been a hot button in this countrys history and it needs to be pushed harder  if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony its about promoting racial healing
word
the name of the show
im feelin dis
dont worry about that thats my department  now who do we cast we need a star  can whoopi sing or dance
thats a great handle
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons  mantan and sleep n eat  the dusky duo
ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire
yep you guessed it
protest finally forced amos and andy off the air  could stop us from ever getting on
negroes would be in an uproar
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer  he has educated feet
we gonna hit em wid da bomb dickey on dis one  whats the setting
and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry make us laugh make us look at our own humanity  make us feel good to be alive
thatswhatimtalkinbout thatswhatimtalkinbout  hes off the hizhook
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this  this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm one misstep and were doing amos and andy  only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain
i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself if not the pilot soon after
youre telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot
besides what does he know about negroes
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video
thats exactly my point  has he even directed actors before in anything
in the immortal words of derrick coleman whooopdeedamndoo
im gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone
i will not be held responsible for these revisions  these changes are not the way i want to go  this is an outrage  this is a sham  a violation
i dont give a good goddamn about finland norway sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from
funnier to who and at whos expense dunwitty when negroes start to run amok the boycotts when the demostrations commence im giving them your home address  lets see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich connecticut
yo dela i just got the news from the cns brass  they saw some clips from the pilot and theyre rushing it onto the air  yo were a midseason replacement ordered 12 shows  were on in 3 weeks  didya hear what i just said yo
this has to be a big mistake
hold on a sec i got a call
i gots to go its my moms
what do you want
go away unless you got my money
son  good to seeya  good to seeya
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
good woman  i trained her right
purely for medicinal purposes
i did  im not an alcoholic  i just like to drink
thats what im askin
thats the only reason period they only want one certain kind of black comic
enough about me whats happening with you
dem white boys giving you a hard time
the truth is never let them seeya sweat  you do that thats half the battle
three nights charleston south carolina
lets get him over to the bed

glad to meet you too  you are all your father talks about
how long has my father been like this
so he drank himself into a stuper
so whats up with you
dont tell him its from me or he wont take it
he never showed it
how was it
nobody told me anything
manray
how did you know
how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought its scary
manray was under our nose the whole time
you lost me
what point is that
sounds risky to me
im in till the end
cant you just quit  walk away
maybe something happened to them maybe theyre lying in an alley bleed to death
hello
you okay
what is your problem
why did you even come up with that shit if you didnt want it made
even if money wasnt an issue dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
i wouldnt bet against it  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
good morning for those of you who dont know me im pierre delacroix im running things and this here is my assistant sloan hopkins
this is the group i was telling you about
youve said that already
just want to say good luck
your life will never be the same
we both lied to him

i want to apologize about my brother and the maumaus  i should not have imposed them on you
whos side are you on
what would their reaction be  i hadnt the foggiest
so you have your small victory now what

whyd you do that
how long have you and hambone been hangin out
that crazy brother of yours doesnt think so
oh is he  you getting jiggy with mantan
dunwitty and i feel youve been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
dela you should try it sometime come into the light
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light  this bucket of blood

i wont forget  when are you coming up here to see your mother
nice to meet you  if you dont mind me asking you  how old are you
where are you from
finland

a fiasco  a disaster  a boondoggle an abomination
ahhh  i never heard of that term before  i thought you were black of africanamerican  no
how did you get this gig
this is a tv show not a music video
good luck jukka  do a good show
i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings  through the roof  but in this game you gotta be one two three steps ahead  i introduce you to myrna goldfarb shes the best media consultant in the biz
myrna is here to help us plan our strategy
the mantan manifesto  catchy aint it  number one  we gainfully employ african americans in front of and behind the cameras  two let the audience decide  three who put these critics in charge these socalled cultural police four  who determines what is black five  mantan is a satire  six if they cant take a joke f em

good day to you young sir
where are you bound for
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel
and ill tell you what mr dugan ive been insulted grossly in this house  i aint at all satisfied with these here ways of going on im an englishman i am and a man of property and i  i 
both of us ride home with best here
theres nothing else for it  take your ground grogan  twelve paces i suppose
hoitytoity  john best whats the matter here
well well  what is it  well make you used to our ways or adopt english ones
pooh  pooh  best you are joking
my companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about england which i answered as best i might  but this best i am bound to say was bad enough  i knew nothing about england and i invented a thousand stories which i told him described the king and the ministers to him said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him
ogrady
this is a very good inn  shall we stop for dinner
ah  you sly rogue i see that will influence you
wheres the beauty you promised me
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly
sir im a british officer
good morning private james  please come in  i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police herr galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemens promotion
what is the service sir
you are a hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins  he gambles a great deal and wins  do you know the cards well
what are the chevaliers intentions
has he sent the challenge yet
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner  when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
dorothy might love me or not as she likes but best will have to fight me before he marries her
a pretty days work of it you have made master roderick  knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred ayear into the family  best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so he takes a girl without a penny  a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father
and this is the return you make for his kindness  didnt he harbor you in his house when your father died and hasnt he given you and your mother rentfree your fine house of jamesville yonder
well if it must be it must  for a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw  no officer bearing his majestys commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it  fight you must and best is a huge strong fellow
have you taken my message to him
my mare is saddled and ready whos the captains second
thats a very handsome sword you have there
and now you risk the same fate  if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bullys body
ill match any man with the sword
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
look here roderick my boy this is silly business  the girl will marry best mark my words and as sure as she does youll forget her  you are but a boy  best is willing to consider you as such  dublins a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service  make best an apology and be off
grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which i wanted of my family
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown
theres only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband  she is now mrs john best
no the very same one my boy  he recovered from his wound  the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him  it was only made of tow do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred ayear out of the family  the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you  but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
mr ohiggins i cannot say how grateful i am for your timely assistance to my wife
mr ohiggins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin  mister ohiggins i wonder if i know your good father
oh i am thinking of the ohiggins of redmondstown  general ohiggins was a close friend of my wifes dear father colonel granby somerset
whom have i been harboring in my house  who are you sirrah
youre an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me
i dont know
chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it if you will be patient maybe i will pay you something another time
where is my rascal lazlo
good gracious  what is this
it is shameful  infamous  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassadors house
ten thousand  but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
all europe shall hear of this
i have no luggage
you are the young man who m de seebach recommended
your name is lazlo zilagyi
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
for whom else have you worked
who else can give me information about you
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood
the cards are now my only livelihood  sometimes i am in luck and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see  its property look you and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me when the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste  do you understand the cards
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
i believe they will deport you
but if they send you away then what is to become of me
gentlemen i wish you a good day will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel  that should be work for a hangman
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him
i entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady
perfectly so and what is more i will tell you that i love her and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals
then you yield to me
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
no
never
not even that
not one
that man has perhaps not yet been born
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more  i could value only someone whom i loved
your word empty makes me laugh is it fortunate or unfortunate  if it is fortunate i congratulate myself  if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
it is only too possible  love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
how so
you want my heart
to make me wretched in two weeks
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness
you will do as you please  it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other  do you not agree
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end
will we always leave it at this
i know better than you do  love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away
let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew
shall i tell you something  i believed what was called love came after the union  and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead  and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love inexpressible love  god of nature bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter  divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes
as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you  but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much
my lady cosgroves relationship with me was a singular one  her life was passed in a series of crackbrained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me  we would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes  one day i was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth  she suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me
lady cosgrove you are an old fool
i accept but i insist on a wager the loser must do whatever the winner pleases
i feel the ribbon
why are you shaking
i hate miss clancy you know i do and i only danced with her because  because  the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden
but you refused me dorothy
if ever i meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two  ill fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is
suppose now roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side
what with me on the pillion  would you kill poor me
monster  your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop  but ill have my revenge i will  roddy will you see me insulted
i am at your service mr cosgrove how much do you wish to spend
as much as possible
all the same you must name an amount
last month the duke of suffolk spent no more
and to be sure i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister lord west whose acquaintance i made as i had so many others at the gaming table
by name only
have you done mr cosgrove
does this assignment interest you
was he cheated
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country
then this must be done tomorrow
what has happened madam to annoy your ladyship
be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong  have you lost much
that fool didnt know what was the meaning of a hundredpound bill which was in the pocketbook that the fellow took from me
but i shouldnt like to put you to such trouble mister
as you have been robbed of your purse may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies  in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality  to the ladys question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
i have good news for you mr cosgrove  the firm of bracegirdle and chatwick in the city of london are prepared to lend you 20000 pounds pledged against your interest in the edric mines  they will redeem the encumbrances against the property which amount to some 10000 pounds and take a twenty year working lease on the mines they will lend you the 20000 pounds against the lease income which they will apply to the loan as it comes in and they will make a charge of 18 per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance
considering your financial circumstances mr cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you  i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity but obviously if you would reject this offer i shall keep trying to find a better one
there are a few other points we should discuss  the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyships signature and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyships freewill in giving her signature
may i be quite frank with you
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyships perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital
did you buy the horse papa
but i will have it on my birthday wont i
good night papa
papa
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that youve already bought my horse and that its at doolans farm where mick the groom is breaking it in  is that true papa
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolans farm to see him
your bother is in america fighting the rebels
yes hes fine
i made sir william cosgroves acquaintance as usual at the play table  one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth
indeed you are right sir  look at me  marriage has added forty years to my life  i am dying a wornout cripple at the age of fifty  when i took off lady cosgrove there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself  fool that i was i had enough with my pensions perfect freedom the best society in europe  and i gave up all these and married and was miserable  take a warning from me mr roderick and stick to the trumps  do anything but marry
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
sir william cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches  he was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live i dont know how many years  if cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady  but my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account
i beg your pardon
gentlemen see this amiable youth he has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin mr hunt who has asked for advise from my wife lady cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith  did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple
well if my intentions are what you think they are  if i do wish to step into your shoes what then  i have no other intentions than you had yourself  lady cosgroves wealth may be great but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily  her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition  i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her and if i win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight
sir let those laugh that win
charming schuvaloff
dark valdez
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
he is only curious to know who you are
he loves me as i love you
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him
dont like em dont eat em dont make no damn difference to me

hurricane kept you up too
bill styles

you framedhim
this isnt our area whose area is this 
hey i   holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do

shut the fuck up you fucking faggot you just shut the fuck up
west was one thing but this 
we finished the course and came here then heard an explosion   wheres pike
what about you wandering around alone at least we have an alibi 
holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
yeah right
you too
why not
youre under military arrest its not gonna happen whats wrong with baseball
well its a game of anticipation thats the beauty
i dont know i like the army
you did basic here
theres no need
right now im gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more okay
whyd you ask for a cop ray
some
and those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
you smoke ray
hey ray just had a nice talk with your buddy kendall  seems you killed three people
thatd be my reaction too 
well why didnt you say so well just drop all your charges then 
fuck youre serious raymond you got exactly zero truck with us right now wed take the word of a crackhead over yours so if youve got something to say say it
so childs made some side money so what people are dead ray and the only one we have to blame is you 
i apologize 
and hed been shot
you shot childs and nunez
you saved kendalls life 
raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony otherwise this is just another story 
were not finished yet 
we dont need the tapes 
not true cadet ive got a gun 
he  he made me do it 
i guess nunez wasnt dead after all he came after us with a vengeance  you know the rest
i promised them id ask you where west and the others are
are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you
that first night with pike i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
he was sickly had that shaking thing whatdyacall it epoxy
he said he worked there 
what business
where
what about the phosphorous grenade
back up
why didnt you tell us all this in the first place
wheres the cabin
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too
is that what i did now and of course you can prove all of it
ohhhh i dont think so
cadet whats your name
you know how to work a pistol dunbar
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours he is not to be given food water or clothes if he so much as moves you are to blow his nigger brains out is that clear
what the fuck is going on
he wouldnt kill anybody
shut up  let me see your grenades
jesus what happened
pike and i got separated then i heard gunfire close
so you killed him
whose blood is that jay
what do you mean wests
where have you been jay
roberto what the fuck
you know its not like that 
right
you gotta untie me  i didnt do this thing ray
maybe but that dont make me a killer 
ray this is my life here i aint gonna pretend im not happy west is gone but you know i couldnt have done this its not in me
mueller
were sweeping our area and suddenly hes gone couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away 
you hated west mueller loved him 
bullshit
why
combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me
why why didnt you tell me
that still doesnt mean you didnt kill him
full clip to the body 
his chest was hamburger 
way i figure it west must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them so they decided to get rid of him first
i i dont know
theres no time to think ray we gotta get out of here you untie me we grab the guns get kendall and nunez and make a run for it 
a test will no doubt link you to the killing 
you ive seen you around the base but you  youre not army are you
thats it youre that policeman with friends in low places tell me hows guissepe torres doing these days those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer 
ive done nothing wrong  im the victim here
my father is a powerful man over the years hes used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain unpleasantries  i am a homosexual
he is not shall we say wild about the idea he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet what do you think of that
levi i dont know if youre familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one
what happened to degrees
maybe i shouldnt tell you that maybe i should tell you i wasnt scared at all but i was  enough to almost kill him
he admitted it
why did he come back for you
okay i think thats it he rises and walks to the door
somebody emptied a full clip into him 
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar 
epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
is it the truth
why did you tell us he shot everybody levi you put him in for three murders the man saved your life 
dunbar was running out the door ohhhhhh see thats where i was confused because i thought you said nunez was running out the door
i believe your next line is what are you trying to hide
dunbar will testify that you were
something funny levi
jail if hes lucky the gas chamber if hes not 
why
how do you know
or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
you lied to us levi youre going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
where are they
maybe what 
how are you
that bad
this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
the official term for it is clusterfuck by the time beth hit us id canceled all off base exercises save one  a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush were missing three and the sergeant the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names but the sergeant
a few years ago the army picked our good buddy as their go to noncom to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder gentler military he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country
the exercise was one of his section eight private sessions left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning
no the problem is ones dead ones got a bullet in his arm and one wont talk the one who wont talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup
which gives us about five hours whyd you call me
tom bottom line i let those kids go out there if jag shows up and i dont have any answers for them my career is finished 
hes not done by a longshot i can get more out of him 
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez
weve already been over the terrain twice nothing
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime
without the body we have no physical proof we need a confession
nevertheless 
you mean not enough to save you
tom where are you going 
you want a confession why dont you confess bill people are dead and you dont give a shit about it only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault 
what i said before 
yeah
its over time of death was 442 jags been notified and i called the senator myself my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable you two had no culpability in the matter
you think you could explain all this to me
theyre taking your command arent they
im sorry bill
youre a good soldier bill
it was so good i actually forgot youre one of the bigger dogs now the base commander the one in control you couldnt let him testify could you
if you let him testify then it would have all come out west was supposed to take care of it out there shut nunez up and then disappear but it got messy and people got killed so you called your old pal tom hardy figuring if worse came to worse hed cover for you
stay where you are
what i cant understand is why you signed these if youd just let west take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too
toxicology report came back kendalls attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe youve heard of it its for asthmatics if an epileptic takes enough it kills them i checked with the nurses at the hospital  youre the only other person who visited kendall
you poisoned him bill you heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like pike
no you will stand there and you will listen what happened to you bill you were the one who joined up to do good in the world you were the one who believed in it 
no more witnesses wests a ghost but it doesnt matter because we have your signature the hospital log and kendalls toxicology report and thatll be enough
you cant duck this bill i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i wont let this happen
hostile and uncooperative
ah christ
i didnt mean that as a compliment
gotta be honest i love what youve done with the place 
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff i owe him
it was for suspicion of bribery its really all in the wording 
three things first  you dont have a choice second  ive never taken a bribe in my life and third  im still a little drunk from last night so if i skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you try not to take offense tell me about the two guys
levi who names their kid levi 
christ remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone 
hes in interrogation
move him
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which doesnt exactly put people at ease is he cute
is dunbar cute
thank you at some point in there im gonna rub my nose when i do go at him with everything you got
i questioned him for three hours and he didnt make a sound you dont have a badge he wont talk to you
the colonel saw you shoot nunez youre a murderer 
baseball
you made me look like an idiot 
you really want to make banal chit chat like that now
were in the middle of a murder case 
what is that
typical army brat story dad was noncom mom was a nurse there was never any real doubt of joining up
something like that you
youre kidding
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about isnt it
you do understand that theres absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right
youre off to a late start
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
hes telling the truth up to a point
something wrong
remember hes the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves
that was kid gloves
but we have to question him   thought you didnt have cigarettes 
too neat how long have you been an investigator
i just he came back for kendall i dont think hes capable of murder
look all weve got is what kendall says and he didnt actually witness any deaths except nunez he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies  he didnt see any crime committed
why the fuck wasnt he in restraints
styles couldnt reassign him hes a legend 
goddammit hardy you cant just leave 
west was a monster fifteen years ago i was here i was section eight i was pike fuck being the knife dummy  that thing he did stripping pike down making him stand outside all night he did that every year he did that to me fifteen years ago i wanted him dead and now im supposed to care that somebody offed him sorry no can do i tried
i was starting to believe you you know that you werent who everyone said i guess i was wrong 
why do you care
i didnt shoot west
at least you and kendall agree on that
talk it through childs mueller and nunez know theyre going out on the regular tuesday night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it kill west pin it on pike
dunbar
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
so its a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story 
buttfucks the cabin
so why after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house does the senators son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber
little bit
were fucked i know 
what
are you sure
why dont you talk to levi off the record for a second
thats a fantastic idea 
i pushed him too hard
yeah i couldve shouldve
no i didnt i wanted to humiliate him for what he did to dunbar for fucking over the little guy
you wanted to break him
so what now
think itll work
you know you never told me why you left the army
for what
we were close to something with kendall
no
four 
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down
hardy what are you doing 
we can tie you to the chair if itll work better for you 
no bodies no west
we need to talk 
what
this isnt the time 
what if i dont want it
thats not true
youre a good man hardy
west
do i have a choice in this
what are you doing out here
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
nah
a word of advice about women  that first hour or so after they kill their boss probably not the best time to hit on them
your phone number
he was your friend
the thing is weve got a real opportunity here you turn me in tomorrow and were both fucked 
how
i dont think i want to hear this 
pike please 
maybe we shouldnt go
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
we should tell him were not going
they found him poor fucker was practically blown in half 
pike and i got separated 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
i was freezing from the hurricane 
we just want 
he couldnt kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
he said what
no one else heard it
nunez was chasing dunbar
but you didnt see it right
pike never confessed
running out of time are we tick tock ticktock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
pike never confessed
dunbar says you were
you and dunbar got your stories straight little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you you think youre just going to slide out of this youre an accessory to murder levi youre going to jail 
it doesnt matter levi were going to find those bodies and when we do im going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon 
it wont work 
enjoy your flight to washington 
dunbars telling the truth
who levi 
i told him what had really happened to west told him to keep quiet about it or id destroy him because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam my father would be finished
what happened with nunez
hurricanes due after midnight and were still going out
what the fuck happened to you 
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first 
thank god
this place is going mueller we gotta move 
we all know what you did pike i dont know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here but 
i used it to start the fire 
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here 
cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west 
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard 
until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant wests body 
tell him to shut up 
sign here and here  hey aint you the folks workin on that whole hulabaloo from last night
funny i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
so
this is totally unnecessary 
but this guy you called hes not even army 
hes not army its not official 
search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup if theyre hurt and we can get to them in time
you think he did it
what do you think
you want kendall dont you
you both know if you do this if you go after a senators son and youre wrong its not just me in the hot seat anymore
what happens to dunbar now
you never told me why you got kicked out of
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives you have chosen to join my army this army is my mother my father and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze do you understand me  give me a sir yes sir
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit and those who refuse to quit i will kill you ever hear of a training accident  give me a sir yes sir
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone as it would weaken the fabric of this nations defense this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me understand  give me a sir yes sir
some of you may have heard theres a hurricane coming american soldiers do not wait for good weather  they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh feel free to lay down and die you get me
great great thats fantastic
hey kid your friend just made himself a star

bloom
what the hell are you doing this is my girl mine

glad to see youre not trying to have a heartfelt talk its one of my greatest annoyances when people talk to those who cant hear them
how long have you known my father
how would you describe him
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born
not that one the real story did he ever tell you that
did you see that woman
well she uh

so ive heard
in so many words yes
helping people makes me happy
youre beamens daughter your last name is different  you married
i wont be selling you this house mr bloom
its okay just leave it
lord im sorry i
ill
dont dont be embarrassed i should never have let you think that  i am in love with my wife
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die shes the only one
really
hi how are you feeling
means when you dream about something thats going to happen  like one night i had a dream where this crow came and told me your aunt is going to die i was so scared i woke up my parents they told me it was just a dream to go back to bed but the next morning my aunt stacy was dead
because see my mother was banging the milkman
he was buttering her rolls pumping her churn splashing milk in her box
spooning the sherbet
you dont need a picture just look up handsome in the dictionary
thats because we didnt have a wedding your motherinlaw was never supposed to marry me she was engaged to somebody else
will never told you that  probably just as well he would have told it all wrong anyway all the facts and none of the flavor
i thought you said you didnt have a church wedding
is it the medicine thats making you thirsty
there was one time when i was eleven
i didnt forget i was just working on a tangent see most men theyll tell a story straight through and it wont be complicated but it wont be interesting either
hardly two stories in the whole place now ive heard in real cities theyve got buildings so tall you cant even see the tops of em
wouldnt lie to you and theyve got allyoucaneat buffets you can eat a lot cant you
youre just trying to get me to leave arent you thats why they sent you here
karl
you dont like it
okay
what did she say
you know anyones whos taken it
youre not trying to run away
you can see my predicament my wedding ring the symbol of fidelity to my wife soon to be the mother of my child was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish
what a fathers not allowed to talk about his son
jesus christ
come on will everyone likes that story
the one about the witch
you    are in for a surprise
having a kid changes everything i mean theres the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
no but i hear its terrible then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine
people neednt worry so much its not my time yet this isnt how i go
truly i saw it in the eye
she was a witch
i saw my death in that eye and this is not how it happens
there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office
and every day i gave him a quarter every day then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks and when i went back there you know what he said
you owe me threefifty
when did you ever work in an office
dad im hoping we can talk about some things while im here
your mother hasnt been keeping up the pool if you wanted to you could
you know where the chemicals are
i thought you werent dying
why not religion dad
josephine actually went to the congo last year
did i ever tell you about how
the maple tree and the buick we heard it
but the real story is how i got the car you see
son
do you know much about icebergs dad
dad
im trying to make a metaphor here
the thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them the other 90 percent is below the water where you cant see it and thats what it is with you dad im only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
you tell lies dad you tell amusing lies stories are what you tell a fiveyear old at bedtime theyre not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty and the thing is i believed you i believed your stories so much longer than i should have and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible  everything  i felt like such a fool to have trusted you you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined just as charming and just as fake
dad im about to have a kid of my own here it would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me
what do you want will who do you want me to be
the river
tell me how it happens
i can try dad if you help just tell me how it starts
lets get out of here
where are we headed
its unbelievable
you become what you always were a very big fish  and thats the way it happens
im sorry
oh
daffodils
how did you get so many
you dont even know me
how can i convince you to stop
i was drying out
wait i need those
ive been working on this poem for 12 years
this is why you dont show work in progress
i cant imagine any place better than here
its me norther winslow
i dont believe it
so what are you up to now
this is it the whole vault
oh oh
are you jenny hill
how did you know my father
were you and my father having an affair
can i ask you a question why did you come here today if you found this deed why didnt you just ask eddie
look i dont know how much you want to know about any of this you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it especially this late in the game
logically you couldnt be the witch because she was old back when he was young
you didnt become crazy
thank you ill bet you need to 
i spent a week in morocco for the story it was incredible
im going to get started on dishes
im going to check on him
im sorry it seems every hour i have to
do you like it being pregnant
its bad
you need to go
im going with you
i talked with your father last night
you never told me how your parents met
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that
mmm
do you love your father
you have to understand when i was growing up he was gone more than he was here and i started thinking  maybe he has a second life somewhere else with another house another family he leaves us he goes to them or maybe there is no family maybe he never wanted a family but whatever it is maybe he likes that second life better and the reason he tells all those stories is because he cant stand this boring place
look i know why you like him i know why everyone likes him but i need you to tell me im not crazy
i need you on my side
what happened
how did you get here
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
is that dr bennetts car
how is he
how much time does he have left
i dont know if youve seen it but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek
mom would you say you understand dad
what i mean is do you really know whats going on in his head
how is that possible i mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly its another one of his stories  you cant honestly say you know him
would you say you understand josephine
josephine and i have a lot in common
i know its not easy just remember he didnt choose to be your father and you didnt choose to be his son you just ended up together you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and itd be just the same if you ask me its a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all
before i forget your father has papers in the basement id like you to go through i wouldnt know whats important
was she one of your teachers
that really happened
is he awake
mom
did you and dad have any other property
so you never bought any land
i dont suppose one of us could stay with him in case he  in case he wakes up one of us should be there
mom do you want some time with dad
you first
put it in the cases split it up and dont forget you owe me 150
you know what for

the facts of life  ill be blunt to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system at least by men makers or not it fatal  a coding sequence cant be revised once its established
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies  like rats leaving a sinking ship  the ship sinks
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells
but not to last
also youre too valuable to experiment with
ive done some questionable things
i like a man who stays put  an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times you live here all by yourself do you

machines can be helpful sometimes but they can also be a pain in the ass  ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill  i dont mind a bumsteer once in a while  its their personalities that usually get me  somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image  if thats true whoever made esper should have been shot
you equipped for random questions
you start
how do i stop one
okay but
heres something you might find interesting  they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum however after a period of time it is only logical that such a mechanism would create its own emotional responses hate love fear anger envy

but you havent put in for emigration
youre going to be over the limit
what if you change your mind
you sure
why didnt you go
my job is here
taffey lewis
id like  you to take a look at these pictures
you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little what am i supposed to be looking for
this one looks familiar but i dont know  naw  theres one came in today looks a little like this one but
who
nothing  she wanted to know about suck night
i didnt know if i wanted to handle her  i already got a snake act  but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones
thats what we call in the trade audition freefor alls and most of it sucks bit i dont think thats her
book the good ones for where
what shows
yeah
theres been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place
how do you mean exploited
are you for real
what the fuck for
it that mother real
its a good job
the best
jeezus
youd be surprised what a guyll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
me
it seems your department doesnt believe out new unit is to the public benefit
its artificial
are you apprehensive
i wouldnt accept it  also id report the person who gave it to me to the police
id take him to the doctor
in a magazine you come across a fullpage photo of a nude girl
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend and you decide to get an abortion
why not
in your opinion
last question  youre watching an old movie  it shows a banquet in progress the guests are enjoying raw oysters
is there anything else
ive already got more help than i need
theres two reasons a man rejects help  either because hes so good at what he does he doesnt think he needs it or hes so insecure he cant admit it
two of us might be more effective than one
you use your equipment dont you
do i make you nervous
i can imagine
they probably want to find out when they were made
dont just stand there looking at me  its not polite
you ever take a bath with a man before
i told you id come back
who is this
where is he
how come youre not on the job
how are you doing
what do people do in the afternoon
do you dream
did you cry when your father died
nobody is freer than when he dreams  i read that
i dont know i have nothing to compare it to  i guess i thought there was something more to it
i dont know i think i missed something
when was the last time you cleaned this place
have you ever cleaned your apartment
they could clean around the arrangement
but if i dont plug it in how can i
but then how can you
this feels stupid
youre sick deckard
have you ever known anybody a long time
uhhuh
ten years
why do you call it retire why dont you call it murder
dont you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
do you think i simulated what happened between us
dont leave here  dont open the door dont answer the phone
you know what i think
where the hell you been
next time you go on vacation do me a favor let us know where it is
bad
thanks
is this to be an empathy test
may i ask a personal question
have you ever retired a human by mistake
but in your profession that is a risk
like you said mr deckard a machine can be a hazard  the voightkampff scale is a machine isnt it
well
how many questions did it take
she didnt know
how many questions does it usually take mr deckard
and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground
lets keep our eyes on the road deckard
were going to have to start the sequence again if you dont stay with me deckard  concentrate
youre not responding to the stimulus  i can see right here im not getting a reading
i kinda get nervous when i take tests
already had iq test this year  but i dont think i never had a

whats the capitol
hello its anchorage  gotcha
this must be very new
its so small
i dont think so
no
mt mckinley  its also the highest point in north america
that would knock my father out
oh yes  it would probably kill him
yes he likes windows
i guess itsjust a matter of personal taste
not on him
why not he has great pants
isnt it a little tiring to sit up straight like that
i guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new
the recovery is very impressive
thats why little things mean so much to him
why did you park way back there
what
yes lying is always a very effective dating tool
im sorry i took the lords name in vain again didnt i  im so sorry

really
for petes sake calvin  weve got guests
well put it down and come in
im sorry everyone but given this extraordinary turn of events i think its prudent that we cut the evening short im sure this cuban thing will resolve itself but in the meantimeid suggest taking a prayerful watchandwait stance
its time
it shuts off automatically
no  they all do
you hear that
calvin i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes its not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates
cheese is particularly troublesome
oh much worse but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip you remember that
how long will we have to stay down here
days
but what if i go into labor that could happen any time
now you listen to me calvin webber when this baby comes youre going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers

yes you certainly will and youll find a nice girl and rebuild america just the way it used to be
hi honey
calvin

im going to give it to you straight theres no point in beating around the bush there were survivors apparently the fallout has createda subspecies of mutants
others aremultisexual  it seemsthey can be both masculine and femininesimultaneously
yes
theyve done a lot of rebuilding but society at least as we knew it has utterly collapsed people throw up in the streets others point guns theres something terribly wrong with the automobiles andand ii cant tell you the rest  i just cant
we stay down here
yes
for how long  weve just about run out of everything
no calvin  were not going to make do  not me  not adam  were going up no matter what  we deserve it even if its terrible
i want him to at least see the sky
and the ocean  a mountain range
hes smart
and lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son adam  amen

nine bodies
mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin on bail the same day
where are you goin  did you tell him
who did you kill
so what do you think
weve teamed up with a sex offender
give the guy a shot
there he goes  okay gentlemen are we ready to bring this man into the light are we ready to truly do the work of the lord
thats the guy that got us off the hook with the checkov thing
he isnt to be touched
now you will receive us
we do not want your tired and sick
it is your evil who will be sought by us
each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies
these are not polite suggestions they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost 
for if you do there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three and on that day you will reap it
i prefer to be called rozengurtle by men
okay just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is
yeah
i knew you two pricks would give me problems give me shit cause im a woman im not gonna take your male dominance bullshit
baumgartner sound irish to you fuck face
holy shit youre the first one thats ever got that
and number three dolly
so what do we do now
she was in here when it went down
they were wearing masks
only two did the shooting  so what are you thinking russian retaliation
maybe the three of them had something in common
and its the same story over here why the crossover  theories
the shooter knew these guys huh
no fuck you you start getting excited we gotta fucking go
what
i killed your fuckin cat you druggie bitch
i felt it would bring closure to our relationship
your what your fuckin what
your what bitch ill shoot myself in the head you can tell me that cats name go ahead your what your precious little 
peeperman wrong what color was it
so what are you thinkin here
so duffy got any theories to go with that tie
the what man
well freud was right so you think they came for the fag man huh and what do you base this upon
and the pennies
thats a possibility yknow you boston cops are perking up thats two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally sized men  another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent
the greeks the italians
the two bullets went in here through the top of the skull crisscrossed and exited through the eyeballs this one clue tells us three distinct facts number one duffy
now stay with me boys what did they do to make two such identical wounds did one guy put him on his knees pop a cap in sit him back up and shoot him again the same way no two men of similar height dropped this guy down each put some iron to his head and boom thats all she fuckin wrote
now what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you
allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry as im sure youve never been in one of these places before a man goes into the booth puts the money in the slot the dancer gets it on the other side she hits the button door goes up now there is only glass between you and its  little fireman time
jesus i just cant think anymore that scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out
a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight fled the scene dont have much on him
these two fucking scenes are related too many coincidences same day five hours apart dead mobsters on both scenes now why did he kill the bartender
duffy this look like a fucking post office to you this guy came in here with intent maybe he didnt know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea the bartender wasnt a fucking accident
thats one big fuckin shoe and think about it of all the ways to kill a guy crushin him to death thats very particular you dont get many of those i dunno i feel something big here i wouldnt be surprised if we see more of these turning up
who the
chief what the fuck is this
hes struck again hasnt he greenly
how many bodies greenly
while greenlys getting coffee anybody else want anything
uh  shit i uh
after talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth after she watches them whack him she passes out  why the two extra victims
they werent related the guy used a 38 no pennies totally amateur
a couple of peons for the mob and
what if it was just one guy with six guns
what the
oh my god

i think you might of dreamed this one anthony
why
see thats what im saying it has the logic of a dream
what does starsky say
this is he
did you see what i meant about the window
thats true but what if they change the locks
now that window can never be locked its impossible
shes really kind of hot
its got a v8 dignan
anthony well get two hundred for the coin collection alone thats less than what its appraised at
the list dignan i know you remember the list because you signed it things dignan was not supposed to touch
that doesnt make any difference i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday they have a very special value for her
where are you going
how was i ridiculing you
did you see that
im lookout
i dont think so just reach on in
it had an alarm
holy shit whatd i tell you
but he didnt say anything
is it back in
loop around real fast
ok escape route the most important thing you can have is an escape route just in case somebodys tailing us or even chasing us as the case may be 
now one thing we need to discuss is timing timing is absolutely crucial what are you doing anthony
anthony give me the fucking gun
dignan calm down
calm down take a deep breath
wheres the manager
theres another stocker right
is that the manager
holy shit
what about what that guy said
i swear to god in a very quiet voice
yeah
whats wrong with him
anthony he sat in the car and watched a 411 in progress he got what he deserved
i didnt realize you were so sensitive to bobs feelings considering i did the plans youre actually lucky you got 
can i get that credit card from you
why not
shes not going to notice anthony
well then cut it in half
see if mine are in there
yes they are
what about them
really ok dad but seriously anthony these are fast shoes
thats real cool anthony yeah i wore boots my parents wouldnt buy me any 200 running shoes like yours i wasnt spoiled
ill just say it
ok go ahead
you owe me fifty bucks
look man she didnt know anything about shirts
armored trucks are very difficult to steal anthony
right get back to me on that one once your plan is worth a shit
actually if you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over
dignan i cant get my hair cut thats just not possible all right
no dignan im sorry i cant do that
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut
this is inez carmen anita
inez this is 
may i have a word with you please
what the fuck is going on here
anthony were on the run from the law here did you tell these people your real name
they dont
which one was that
shes from cuba
he needs to hire an attorney
now that makes sense well hang out for a couple of days get a little rr make sure future mans ok and then get back on the road
obviously thats a given
see now weve got a plan
see one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr langstons house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious i had to dive in and save him
mr langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation cpr ive never said this before but frankly i thought anthony was dead the veins in his face were all sticking out his skin was blue he truly did look dead
but if it wasnt for dignan i probably would of died
hes gone he stole the car
that coward son of a bitch
he went back for his brother
whend he tell you
where was i
he told you and you let him do it
if you wanted to go what were you going to do just leave me here by myself
so when you were saying bobs at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act you were just 
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob id be dead
if youd gone with bob youd probably be in weatherford by now of course id be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped
were going over to this bar if you feel like going
why dont you come with us
i cant believe he just jumped you
i wish id been there
man im sorry we just went for a walk 
i have an idea for that
inez has a master key to all these rooms doesnt she  doesnt she
i know we can its real simple we go into a room grab some car keys and 
she doesnt need to know
look im ready to get the fuck out of here its real torture for me to be here getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans
no one to back me up now i have a good idea so unless you come up with something better 
i dont think we need any keys dignan i think i can hotwire a car for us
yes i do bob taught me
i think we better go home
im not but theres 
our money situation is not good
weve got sixteen dollars
sixteen dollars
i had to give some to inez
you gave 383 to the goddamn housekeeper what the fuck is your problem
a 500 tip for the housekeeper
thats what she is
youre in love with the fucking housekeeper
whend you get back
whos in the car
applejack would of got him anyway this was just the quicker way
i want you to look at this
its big anthony real big its called hinckley cold storage
mr henry has an inside source we call him steve thats where we get our information
what exactly is this place freezers
what time did he say to be here
you could give somebody a concussion
what do you think
dignan take it easy
he doesnt want to fight
no fighting it wasnt bobs fault
shit dignan
i dont know dignan you went crazy
ok man in blue jeans just left by southwest door he is entering a white van what time is it
ok mark that down
god isnt this great working on the job got a wheel man got a safecracker good friends with mr henry
next week well be drinking pia coladas
or i might end up with a broken nose
ill try not to hold you back tomorrow
i dont want to be too much of a liability
he was a nice guy
do you like inez
yeah as a girl
bird dog to scarecrow bird dog to scarecrow
youre all clear

like amnesia
so is mr henry going to come by and see me or anything

you got to be kidding me
whatd he get
you think applejack knew
why
mr henry never gave you a test did he
youre living on a sailboat

scale the barricade and tunnel through no mans land and bob remember
this is my business manager rowboat
thats a sharp jacket
its hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle
you know your form is for shit but youve got a hell of a talent
every once in a while some cat comes to me he wants to know how i made it how did i become a success  the first thing i tell them is follow your instincts let your instincts guide you the second thing i tell them is for christs sake you got to know your grammar
you mean like techniques
id like to live in that place hinckley cold storage
you mean a safecracker
look at that woman shes what fifty fiftyfive but she hasnt let herself go i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body
tell me something what the hell kind of name is dignan
i guess what im trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan
sure sure hes a great person and id call bullshit on anybody who said differently but i wonder if the kid has the goods  up here
and youre wrong if you think id turn my back on a friend
congratulations you passed the test
that was a test
how does that feel
did dignan take the test
well he agreed 100 that bob should be dropped and he also agreed you were a liability but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses
ill tell you anthony times like this i get philosophical what does it mean whats it all about are you afraid to die
no that door over there
are you afraid
exactly woah
the fear of death the pain of consciousness  did you mix this martini
bob bob thats a palindrome  i love palindromes
this is good
but youre thieves its what you are

bob where you going
why not
youve only been playing for two weeks bob it takes a long time to learn this game
you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to
i know it must of been a bad experience but it doesnt sound like it was your fault
it took six months of research i did all the wiring myself switched ac to dc doubled the voltage shorted out the generator the whole school was shut down
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter thats partly why i was in custody so long sixty days
yeah one minute youre studying great expectations and the next minute youre drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend
i thought he didnt have to pay anything because of the technicality
were you adopted bob
well because you guys dont look alike
was future man adopted
lets not even talk about it
yeah lets keep it 
give him a second

you know bob anthony did kill someone he electrocuted our janitor senior year
it was an accidental i dont want to go into the details it was just one of those senior pranks that didnt really go right i mean obviously since swiftys dead thats why anthony never graduated

im sure he did well have to get new plates
what the fuck possessed you
bob are you coming

leaving was a business decision were both rich come enjoy it
go to the airport get a plane ill have a brass band waiting for you
he left yesterday on the night train hes probably just getting in now  youll have to hurry
treadstone
thats not gonna fly
and what are we looking for
to know about it  it was a kill squad black on black closed down two years ago nobody wants to know about treadstone not around here  you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what youre doing
lets talk about conklin
i want to know what happened
so you had conklin killed  i mean if were cutting the crap
and bourne wheres he now
ivan mevedev  senior financial manager  worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies pecos oil he claimed to know where the money landed we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency this
at the time of his death conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of sevenhundred and sixty thousand dollars
excuse me
may i finish
whats definitive is that i just lost two people in berlin
berlin
you dont know what youre getting into here
call a mayday into berlin station we need snipers dod whatever they got snipers
my ass he does youre playing with fire pamela marshall said nail him to the wall i dont know how you interpreted that but i dont think he meant repatriate him
so whats he doing you believe him
sorry to wake you
what
oh god it must have been bourne
moscow what the hells he going to moscow for
jesus i zorn i have to call his family tell them
sit down
i dont exactly know what to say  im sorry
im not a traitor ive served my ountry
why not it was just money
had to be done
in the end honestly its hubris simple hubris you reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are
sir
she say what time i should call
i did my box work but i wanted to show you before i showed landy i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense i mean im with you on this conklin was a nut but a traitor i just cant get there
you put a fourgam kel on here and its gonna take out power to the building you know that what you cant know is if its gonna blow the room with it
there were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously the second one the one that didnt go off was down here  first of all this is nothing its a subline for the breaker above second why put the charge all the way down here if youre good enough to get in here and handle the gear youre good enough to know you dont need this  bourne would know
is it a slam dunk no but
okay what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne what if bourne didnt have anything to do with this
somethings been going on here in europe and its still going on post conklin whos been in berlin
who else knows about this
show me again
sit can you  the chair have the chair
of all the people in the world youre the only one i have anything to offer  thats why i came here
its nice  does this picture mean anything to you  hmm
no its because you dont know how they died
i would want to know  i would want to know that my mother didnt kill my father i would want to know that she didnt kill herself
it changes things that knowledge doesnt it
thats not what happened to your parents
it was my job my first time your father was supposed to be alone but then your mother she came out of nowhere  i had to change my plan  you understand me  you dont have to live like that anymore thinking that

amnesia
good luck
im curious about bourne your interpretation of his condition you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions
are you an expert in amnesia
believed what
so he fooled you
not good enough youre the person who floated this amnesia story  ever feel sorry for him for what hed been through
you felt nothing no spark two young people in paris dangerous missions life and death
did you
some women like dobermans 
i dont think we need to keep looking for him anyway
is it fresh
what do you think is he coming in
lets give him half an hour
do we know what this says
anything
black coat possibly leather dark slacks dark tshirt  he says theyre gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there and then check them out but
heres what ive got  remember vladimir neski russian politician seven years ago he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel he never did he was murdered
his wife in room 645 then she shot herself 
were looking at all berlin outbound good news is every train station in berlin has thirty to forty fixed digital security cameras common feed
yes in that order
someone dead from this household
what it means in england  and in scotland too  is that rebels have forfeited their lands we were ambushed last night but the scots dragged their dead away
then well just have a peek at the wounds  dig em up
well sleep here tonight youll come home with me well let the house and the lands too plenty of willing neighbors
did the priest say anything about the resurrection or was it all about judgment
what are they doing
but what will you do
a thousand  you have made me guardian of scotland so i tell you this is what we face
peace
with cavalry  not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ  we could outmaneuver their bowmen
sir william we come to seek a meeting
an oath to a liar is no oath at all an oath to a patriot is a vow indeed every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you
i will meet you but only one way  if robert the bruce is there and puts his hand on my bible and swears his loyalty to scotland
young robert we are honored 
a wise plan and how is your father we have missed him at the council
does anyone know his politics
may he rest in peace you have already sealed the coffin
if i pay homage to anothers throne then how am i a king
the crown is that of scotland and scotland is william wallace
he wont come
longshanks promised
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms
what news of the north
while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost our entire northern army wiped out and you have done nothing
wallace has sacked york
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself
now we kill two birds at one stroke we recruit from scotland for our armies in france
what choice do they have now they must serve us or starve
his legend grows it will be worse than before
what is it
so i did and what was so important about it
shut up would you how can i concentrate
no mlord
now my flower do you understand
good day to you mlords
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
the little cow is insane 
is it true wallace is captured
when will his trial be
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace
nor you to you that word is as unfamiliar as love
ill wait back there
we make spears a hundred spears fourteen feet long
the bruce is not coming william
stephen ready
thanks for the food and drink and for bringing em yourselves
rest william
you know its a trap
i dont want to be a martyr
thats just a dream william
your dreams arent about freedom theyre about marion you have to be a hero because you think she sees you is that it
keep these were going too
theyre coming
three maybe more
theyre english soldiers aint they
wanna stay with me tonight
well get those english pigs tomorrow
test of manhood
call it a test of soldiery then the english wont let us train with weapons so we train with stones
i still say this is no test a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can
can you do it when it matters as it matters in battle could you crush a man with that throw
youll move
good to see you again
all right father ill ask him  if i risk my neck for you will i get a chance to kill englishmen
excellent stephen is my name im the most wanted man on the emerald isle except im not on the emerald isle of course mores the pity
we must run in different directions
i am the one who is rotting but i think your face looks graver than mine
so more men were slaughtered uselessly
we must have alliance with england to prevail here you achieved that you saved your family increased your lands in time you will have all the power in scotland yet you grieve
where is my son
i sent for him  and the little coward send you
my sons loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen so he accepted our bribe
then why does he stay my scouts say he has not advanced
you spoke with this wallace in private what kind of man is he
the scottish nobles have sent him no support his army starves our stall has worked he must withdraw you may return to your embroidery
no i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war
forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
i have faced him have you
treason against whom
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king 
 while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times i cannot commit treason if i have never been his subject
i do not confess
your father doesnt like me does he
thank you for accepting
ill invite you again but your mother thinks im crazy
youve been here before
did it work
i want to marry you
im not just saying it
but i wont give you up to any nobleman
i dont want to scare you i want to be yours and you mine every night like this one
ive missed you
tonight then
then when
im dreaming
i dont want to wake i want to stay with you
i need you so much i love you
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes scotland is in chaos your husband is secretly sending an army north
last night i slept with a member of the war council
this scottish rebel wallace he fights to avenge a woman
knowing his passion for his lost love they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife he fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place now that is romance oui
i am the princess of wales
i come as the kings servant and with his authority
i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities the executioner of the kings nephew my husbands own cousin
let us talk plainly you invade england but you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply the king proposes that you withdraw your attack in return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which i am to pay to you personally
peace is made is such ways
i understand you have suffered i know about your woman
a meeting in a barn it had to be a trap and only you would know i would be aware of it
why did you
you have you have a husband
you understand consider before you laugh and say no you will never own a throne though you deserve one but just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule england and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks but with that of a true king
mlady what kindness of you to visit a stranger
will he show mercy to my country will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves
you will die it will be awful
drink this it will dull your pain
wait i respect what you said but remember these men have lands castles much to risk
no but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other if you make enemies on both sides of the border youll end up dead
im no coward i want what you want but we need the nobles
war finds me willing i know it wont bring back all i have lost but it can bring what none of us have ever had  a country of our own for that we need a king we need you
then tell me what a king is is he a man who believes only what others believe is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart there is strength in you i see it i know it
we cant stop
whats the crazy man saying lord
who would do such a thing
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger
fine speech now what do we do
come itll help you sleep
mrs treborn i need to speak with you
i was going to show this to the principal but i wanted to talk to you first
thank you for showing it to me first ill ill take care of it can i have the picture
what
and you say he doesnt remember any of it
just tell me that evan doesnt have jasons illness
anything
why what for
well the good news is that the results are negative ive found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors
unfortunately weve got nothing to work with its harder playing detective now
if i had to guess id say the blackouts are stress related
plenty who knows maybe hes got severe coping problems about not having a father did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friends dad
youd be surprised how often they are
its worth a shot i can arrange a controlled meeting a careful dose of sedatives for jason some security you and i monitoring evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex
evan wake up oh please wake up
actually these tests werent available twenty years ago
no dances just tell me
were gonna be late again
rightytighty leftylucy
darn it
you know the answer to that
weve been over this a hundred times its too dangerous for him
all the dads are gonna be there
no
i dont like this place mom its creepy please can we go i promise i wont make any more bad pictures
thats why i wanted you to come here evan dr redfield already has a background in memory loss
thesell bring you luck crockett
what happened
now your father may seem sleepy to you but thats just because of his medicine okay
i dont know i dont remember
i i blacked out
please mom people will talk
did da  jason  get good grades
why do you ask
i couldnt tell if they were real memories or just phantoms you know he might only have thought he actually remembered them
and then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could
i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal hes sure he can get you off on selfdefense so if youre patient
i dont know these things take time
i found these the others are still in storage
okay doc whats the damage how much time have i got
what does that mean for evan
there must be a way to fix this
youre acting like your father
how did you know that
just like jason
best not bitch up wind up someones luggage that way
youre religious carlos you believe that bit about the lord works in mysterious ways
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose for you to help me
so when im out i need you to watch my face and hands closely
just tell me if anything weird happens
what did you see what did it look like
hello evan its very nice to meet you  hes as handsome as his father
dad lives here
now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny think of it like a movie you can pause rewind or slow down any details you wish understand
where are you now

okay then go a little forward in time what do you see now
go on nothing can hurt you remember this is only a movie youre completely safe
the car doesnt vanish evan the movie in your head has broken thats all but now ive respliced it and i want you to tell me about the car
its a little complicated i havent seen results exactly like these before
this is where were finding most of the hemorrhaging the outer lining of the cerebral cortex
hey evan whats the big rush we dont meet for another hour
books
think evan youve invented a disease that doesnt exist alternate universes with colleges prisons paraplegia
you remind me of your father he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
get dressed thumper youre taking me out for my birthday
its an experiment with flatworms and a maze you take a flatworm and run it through the maze until hes memorized it then you put a new flatworm in the maze hes clueless banging into walls getting lost whatever
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure it gets all of the worms memories
you really think he wanted to kill you
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr miller took his shirt off 
are you stupid or what
whasamatter lost your rolex
get out both of you
we should go soon if dad catches us smoking down here were dead
oh god what did we do

i dont understand where are you taking me
i dont know what to say its beautiful
why are you doing all this for me
its my fault i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago
please evan dont even joke he wouldnt hurt you hes just trying to scare you away from me
its not his fault evan you knew how bad he had it when we were kids
are you okay
its just youve been acting kinda strange you know
i dont know you seem different you make weird jokes your accents changed you dont even walk the same
i cant put my finger on it but everythings a bit off even the dinner tonight it was beautiful but

is something the matter
kayleigh do you ever think about us i mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us

where am i what happened where did we all go
i was just somewhere else  how did i get here

nobody ever loved me that much
you want my advice

monsieur rick i 
excuse me but you look like a couple who are on their way to america
you will find a market there for this ring i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
good
such a bargain but that is your decision
mr berger the ring could i see it again
i recognize you from the news photographs monsieur laszlo
we read five times that you were killed in five different places
i see
monsieur rick may i get you a cup of coffee
well you are in pretty good shape herr rick
oh two weeks maybe three
now you finish locking up will you carl

suppose we ask sam maybe hed like to make a change
i see the bus is in ill take my shipment with me
i never drink in the morning and every time you send my shipment over its always just a little bit short
the bourbon  the news about ugarte upset me very much
of course not what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters i will handle the entire transaction get rid of the letters take all the risk for a small percentage
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
rick ill put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
thats why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
ah to get out of casablanca and go to america youre a lucky man
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but hes worth twenty five
of course they stay ricks wouldnt be ricks without them
dont forget you owe ricks a hundred cartons of american cigarettes
you see my dear the word has gone around
i will stay here and keep on trying im sure in a little while 
weve decided signor ferrari for the present well go on looking for two exit visas thank you very much
i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man monsieur i am moved to make one more suggestion why i do not know because it cannot possibly profit me but have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit
do you know where they are
rick
it was gracious of you to share it with me good day mademoiselle monsieur
and mademoiselle
mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
there are only two other alternatives for him
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
 it was la belle aurore
not an easy day to forget
i remember every detail the germans wore gray you wore blue
say goodnight to sam for me
theres still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
who are you really and what were you before what did you do and what did you think huh
a franc for your thoughts
im willing to be overcharged tell me
yes
why there is no other man in my life
thats easy there was hes dead
richard theyll find out your record it wont be safe for you here
my germans a little rusty
with the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
ten years ago lets see  yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding
strange i know so very little about you
but be serious darling you are in danger and you must leave paris
yes of course we 
no no not at my hotel i uh i have things to do in the city before i leave ill meet you at the station huh
thats too far ahead to plan
well why not the captain on a ship can it doesnt seem fair that hey hey whats wrong kid
oh i saved my first drink to have with you here
please
i wouldnt have come if i had known that you were here believe me rick its true i didnt know
please dont dont rick i can understand how you feel
i didnt count the days
can i tell you a story rick
i dont know the finish yet
its about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo at the house of some friends she met a man about whom shed heard her whole life a very great and courageous man he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals everything she knew or ever became was because of him and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love
im sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night
why did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station
well you can tell me now im reasonably sober
why not after all i got stuck with a railway ticket i think im entitled to know
did you run out on me because you couldnt take it because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time
all the same someday youll lie to laszlo youll be there
how did you get in
i told you this morning youd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule well wont you sit down
you use richard again were back in paris
your unexpected visit isnt connected by any chance with the letters of transit it seems that as long as i have those letters ill never be lonely
i went through all that with your husband its no deal
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause hes fighting for
richard richard we loved each other once if those days meant anything at all to you 
please please listen to me if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth 
no oh richard im sorry im sorry but but you you are our last hope if you dont help us victor laszlo will die in casablanca
 all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything now i want those letters get them for me
put them on the table
for the last time put them on the table
and then
oh it wasnt my secret richard victor wanted it that way not even our closest friends knew about our marriage that was his way of protecting me i knew so much about his work and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me
just before you and i were to leave paris together a friend came and told me that victor was alive they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris he was sick he needed me i wanted to tell you but i i didnt care i knew i knew you wouldnt have left paris and the gestapo would have caught you so i well well you know the rest
now i dont know i know that ill never have the strength to leave you again
oh youll help him now richard wont you youll see that he gets out then hell have his work all that hes been living for
i cant fight it anymore i ran away from you once i cant do it again oh i dont know whats right any longer youll have to think for both of us for all of us
richard victor thinks im leaving with him havent you told him
but its all right isnt it you were able to arrange everything
but why my name richard
i dont understand what about you
no richard no what has happened to you last night we said 
but richard no i i 
im saying it because its true inside of us we both know you belong with victor youre part of his work the thing that keeps him going if that plane leaves the ground and youre not with him youll regret it
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
well always have paris we didnt have wed lost it until you came to casablanca we got it back last night
yes
hello sam
its been a long time
some of the old songs sam
where is rick
when will he be back
does he always leave so early
you used to be a much better liar sam
play it once sam for old times sake
play it sam play as time goes by
victor i i feel somehow we shouldnt stay here
you are very kind
this time they really mean to stop me
i must find out what berger knows
goodnight
goodnight
we are only interested in two visas signor
no ilsa i wont let you stay here you must get to america and believe me somehow i will get out and join you
yes i see when i had trouble getting out of lille why didnt you leave me there and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why didnt you leave me then
he does could we have a table close to him
what happened with rick
our faithful friend is still there
dont joke after major strassers warning tonight i am frightened
whatever id say youd carry on victor why dont you tell me about rick what did you find out
yes
did he give any reason
ask me
ilsa i 
yes victor i was
no victor there isnt
yes yes i know victor whatever i do will you believe that i that 
be careful
are you ready ilsa
captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere i have seen him
yes
rick whos he
 is what
hello rick
well then perhaps you also 
i cant get over you two she was asking about you earlier rick in a way that made me extremely jealous
im afraid major strasser would insist
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and i congratulate you
your work
i hope we didnt overstay our welcome
well come again
good morning
good evening
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you
well isnt there some other place its rather confidential what i have to say
you must know its very important i get out of casablanca its my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement you know what i have been doing you know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that i be free to reach america and continue my work
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia you fought against the fascists in spain
isnt it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
ill raise it to two hundred thousand
there must be some reason why you wont let me have them
i beg your pardon
well this might come in handy
had a close one eh
dont you sometimes wonder if its worth all this i mean what youre fighting for
you know how you sound monsieur blaine like a man whos trying to convince himself of something he doesnt believe in his heart each of us has a destiny for good or for evil
i wonder if you do i wonder if you know that youre trying to escape from yourself and that youll never succeed
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect i know for instance that you are in love with a woman it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman the first evening i came here in this cafe i knew there was something between you and ilsa since no one is to blame i i demand no explanation i ask only one thing you wont give me the letters of transit all right but i want my wife to be safe i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca
monsieur blaine i dont know how to thank you
i brought the money monsieur blaine
but we made a deal
no its all arranged
everything in order
monsieur blaine i dont ask you to explain anything
yes
i understand
monsieur laszlo is it not
i am captain renault prefect of police
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor
no captain please
let us say that it is my request that is a much more pleasant word
my bill
well a precedent is being broken er emil
ricky youre becoming quite human i suppose we have to thank you for that mademoiselle
tomorrow at ten at the prefects office
i am delighted to see you both did you have a good nights rest
thats strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
with pleasure wont you sit down
i am afraid not my regrets monsieur
and the honor of having served the third reich
monsieur insofar as it is in my power 
by the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte
i believe you have a message for him
i am making out the report now we havent quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
im sure youll excuse me if i am not gracious but you see major strasser im a czechoslovakian
ive never accepted that privilege and im now on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
very well herr laszlo we will not mince words you are an escaped prisoner of the reich so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us you have reached casablanca it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca
is that all you wish to tell us
and that is
even in berlin
you will give us the names
and what if you track down these men and kill them what if you murdered all of us from every corner of europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places even nazis cant kill that fast
for the time being
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm major
what else my dear major
oh there is no hurry tonight hell be at ricks everybody comes to ricks
good evening gentlemen
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major
may i recommend veuve cliquot 26 a good french wine
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
ho diplomatist
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too
of course one must admit he has great courage
you see major you have nothing to worry about rick
mademoiselle
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr blaine i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that hes just another blundering american
as to laszlo we want him watched twentyfour hours a day
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
captain renault are you entirely certain which side youre on
we are concerned about more than casablanca we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay
you see what i mean if laszlos presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in casablanca bring on i advise that this place be shut up at once
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
what is the meaning of that phone call
why do you stand here why dont you stop him
hello louis
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
the plane to lisbon  you would like to be on it
it was a combination of all three
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
i was misinformed
rick theres going to be some excitement here tonight we are going to make an arrest in your cafe
if you are thinking of warning him dont put yourself out he cannot possibly escape
you know rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here it will amuse your customers
i see and whats strasser doing here he certainly didnt come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice
thank you rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one that is the reason we permit you to remain open
that is another reason there is a man whos arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa
victor laszlo
rick that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed
it is my duty to see that he doesnt impress the other half rick laszlo must never reach america he stays in casablanca
manages what
oh but i just told you 
this is the end of the chase
is that a serious offer
make it ten i am only a poor corrupt official
done no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i should say two
he is traveling with a lady
i think not i have seen the lady and if he did not leave her in marseilles or in oran he certainly wont leave her in casablanca
it doesnt matter there is no exit visa for him
oh laugh if you will but i happen to be familiar with your record let me point out just two items in 1935 you ran guns to ethiopia in 1936 you fought in spain on the loyalist side
the winning side would have paid you much better
i have my orders
yeah you were saying
oh how do you do
that makes rick a citizen of the world
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present 
oh no rick never 
oh its my party
well ricky im very pleased with you now youre beginning to live like a frenchman
well i told strasser he wouldnt find the letters here but i told my men to be especially destructive you know how that impresses germans  rick have you got these letters of transit
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
so yvonnes gone over to the enemy
as i suspected youre a rank sentimentalist
why do you interfere with my little romances
how can you close me up on what grounds
but you havent any actual proof and you know it this isnt germany or occupied france all you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days you might as well let him go now
 what makes you think id stick my neck out for laszlo
well theyre all excellent reasons
youre not very subtle but you are effective i i get the point yes i have the letters but i intend using them myself im leaving casablanca on tonights plane the last plane
and im taking a friend with me one youll appreciate
ilsa lund  that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape the last man i want to see in america
ilsa is laszlos wife she probably knows things that strasser would like to know louis ill make a deal with you instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years that would be quite a feather in your cap wouldnt it
ill arrange to have laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and thatll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest you get him and we get away to the germans that last will be just a minor annoyance
i see how do i know youll keep your end of the bargain
ricky im going to miss you apparently youre the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i
youre late
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
you know this place will never be the same without you ricky
i have the letters right here
sams piano
 not so fast louis nobodys going to be arrested not for a while yet
i have sit down over there
i suppose you know what youre doing but i wonder if you realize what this means
call off your watchdogs you said
if you dont mind you fill in the names that will make it even more official
well i was right you are a sentimentalist
what you just did for laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him i know a little about women my friend she went but she knew you were lying
i suppose you know this isnt going to be pleasant for either of us especially for you ill have to arrest you of course
well rick youre not only a sentimentalist but youve become a patriot
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while theres a free french garrison over at brazzaville i could be induced to arrange a passage
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
uh huh
where were you last night
will i see you tonight
give me another
rick im sick and tired of having you 
come on were going to get your coat
make it official if you like
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
well there are certain sections of new york major that i wouldnt advise you to try to invade
are my eyes really brown
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
not particularly i understand the point of view of the hound too
youll excuse me gentlemen your business is politics mine is running a saloon
i would advise you not to interfere
hello
get me the radio tower
uh excuse me please hello rick
huh you know rick watching you just now with the deutsches bank one would think youd been doing this all your life
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought 
may i too bad about those two german couriers wasnt it
thank you  will you have a drink with me please
i forgot you never drink with  ill have another please  you despise me dont you
but why oh you object to the kind of business i do huh but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didnt help them thats not so bad through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renaults price i get it for them for half is that so parasitic
well rick after tonight ill be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
one moment tonight ill be selling those for more money than even i have ever dreamed of and then addio casablanca you know rick i have many friends in casablanca but somehow just because you despise me youre the only one i trust will you keep these for me please
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
rick rick help me
sam ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot
hell double what i pay you
boss
boss aint you going to bed
aint you planning on going to bed in the near future
you ever going to bed
well i aint sleepy either
no not me boss
boss lets get out of here
please boss lets go aint nothing but trouble for you here
well take the car and drive all night well get drunk well go fishing and stay away until shes gone
they grab ugarte and she walks in well thats the way it goes one in one out sam
sam if its december 1941 in casablanca what time is it in new york
whats that youre playing
well stop it you know what i want to hear
you played it for her and you can play it for me
if she can stand it i can play it

her temperature is a hundred and four
thats a heavy sedation
i dont know hes just leaving  youre the one who says he needs to see the world  thats what hell dohell see the world

you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they cant get help anywhere else
there was no visible wound

its obviously an aborticide
christ its oil of tansy
if you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c
fuzzy is not uncommon i tell you theres something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers they seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along
i havent either but you will the morons who write the books should do a little research here
wheres the name sheet
he doesnt like it  hes a boy thats why
i dont think so
henceforth you shall be little wilbur
okay hes just a wilbur then
i thought you took care of this it always breaks in the same place its your splice isnt it

how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
its just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
try to look at it this way what choice does buster have what are his options nobody will ever adopt him 
doubtless youll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do
in other parts of the world i suppose there are other ways
are you really so stupid that you imagine youre going to find a more gratifying life what youre going to find is people like the poor people who get left hereonly nobody takes care of them as well and you wont be able to take care of them either theres no taking care of anybody not out there

do you know him
i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissedthat part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here
you cant think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is
i fail to see how a little christianity could hurt anyone here
when the plane was hit the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together the copilot jumped third all on captain worthingtons orders the captain was still flying the plane none of the men of the ground could see the skythats how thick the jungle was they never saw the plane crashthey never heard it crash they never saw captain worthingtons parachute either

thanks for playing along i just have to sit for a while
brutal day they say the streets are lined with money down here but i guess you have to know the secret handshake what are you drinking
my names grant grant ashby
so what do you do
silicon valley
can 
so weve been meeting with banks all day its amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word
dont tell me you started a tech firm here before us
oh well thanks for the drink
uh right and that was it thats when we decided to start our own business no more shithead bosses
what do you do over at your bank grant
heres where a little research comes in handy corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars its a small lie but now were sure hes playing
well typically speaking theyre not as long as you can demonstrate 
thats right and tech firms they tend to scare people off
banks need to know how theyre going to get their money back
listen what im about to tell you im telling you in confidence okay  have you ever heard of a company called bigcom
right the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do they get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company microsoft intel oracle whatever the beauty of it is theyve pretty much sold the company before theyre even real the bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works so they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan
exactly but the catch22 is that you cant tell anyone about the offer because if its public you could start a bidding war and thats considered a breach of etiquette it could kill a deal but wait too long and youre not considered hot anymore
we had to finalize the deal
this has to happen fast
whats this
lets just slow down for a second
then there it is ashby gets the itch
ten percent of how much
same thing with playing a con you have to be able to see that deep
hey jake when am i gonna get to play the inside
yeah but come on all i get to do is cry and get insulted
it can erase all those things about you that you wish didnt exist
and i think its because of this redhead
the antichrist
things are probably going to end badly for you jake
your life flashing before your eyes
grifters
its all about the money isnt it
im not saying anything besides youre one to talk youre the one whos got me on my knees in a dark alley
keeping the fix happy

youre a superstitious fucker
like what
she had you tempting fate
is that what it was jake was it love
so much for honor among thieves you would have cut loose your friends your girl
bullshit you were scared jake you lost your nerve you lost your confidence you werent being noble you werent trying to save anybody but yourself admit it
we were back on
alrlght alrlght what happened today
alright turn around she doesnt get shit unless i get that money where is it
oh jake you disappoint me and you just let lily here down again what was it you said about playing the big con
like putting on a play guess some people forgot their lines

so we go to the bar
well take care of it
ten is standard sir

currently the king pin is a very largetype pole stuck up our asses
independent same shit just independent they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book big fat bald

we meet him with corporate papers inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital the corporate papers are in order but we need things to happen fast our guy fudges numbers in the right places moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom depending upon what we need

he wasnt my boyfriend i had a boyfriend at the time what was his name anyway glenn was like thirty i was only fifteen but he was a nice guy real sweet liked to talk we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that
we were friends i trusted him i should have known it was weird but then again i was weird
no we never got busted we were done with a shift one night both a couple of percocets down and i was telling glenn about my boyfriend about how we were thinking about doing it you know i was thinking about letting him be my first because i loved him  what the hell was his name

your buddy that fat guy the king couldnt wait to have that guy whacked he didnt even know who the guy was but he was so pissed off at him he gets him drilled it aint personal its business
whatd he say
so thats it huh you get the cops to give you a safe ride

coupla things they got this fed looking around and the girl just split
speak
so do half the other people in this place how do i know which one
special agent
preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered so you can imagine the smell bad for the neighbors good for me because in all the time ive been looking for jake this is only the second time ive even gotten a whiff of him
if you feds are so hot for him why dont we just bring him in right now
like we told you before we think hes into something with the king pin 
did he buy it
you guys awake

do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig he sent me a birthday card  belated but its the thought right oh this pricks got a sense of humor but then again you guys probably know him better than i do in fact ive only met the guy once but now now i have you the next best thing his partners his fix
you help me catch him whatever hes into next i want you to be into and what youre into im into if it all goes well those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape ill clear you guys of anything youve ever done with vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation this pricks been on the wish list for so long youll probably get gold shields out of it
peace of mind
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick
good i gotta go  so what do you have for me
hes headed towards the eastern most exit do not under any circumstances approach i want to follow this all the way down to vig

to coincidence
im not much of a gambler really i just like this bar
i was at a loose end a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership
no no i come every couple of years i always think im going to stay im from cape town originally
near the casino
now theres a coincidence my father used to gamble there
i loved the atmosphere but it destroyed my poor mother
and the lies gamblers are born liars
thats africa theres an african in all of us isnt there
do you believe in astrology

i didnt
im in trouble
i owe a lot of money
i know that but you can now
they mean it
my creditors one night around three in the morning theyll come into the casino 
the point is they want a man inside
just listen you dont have to do anything criminal
you dont have to be criminal a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat youll see him stop him and the guy will make a big scene therell be chaos and thats when itll happen
and i thought you were only after my body
whatll you do when it all goes wrong
but if it does
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after they want someone they can be sure of an honest dealer thats the point not all dealers are honest mr reynolds will never suspect you
next time itll be my neck
i want to go back to cape town i want to start again clean
i want you to forget what i said
how much do you owe
did they tell you to sleep with me

how many aces are left

let me just run through a few things as a dealer you never gamble not anywhere well need your picture
for the database it can be accessed by every casino in the country we have the same system for punters
ever
next point friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden
this isnt south africa wed know because someone would report it believe me someone always does
wed know there are no secrets in this casino youd be punished
girlfriend
shes not in the gaming business is she
this is our crows nest im showing it to you now but youll never see it again
you can start monday week
that hair will have to go
i just want the job
why dont you take a break jack
mr tchai always likes to play at that table and only with bella
hes paying out in stacks of 25
thanks for the information
how do you feel jack
i have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand
ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical
im getting this flickering light on one of my panels
the one on unit oh i think its gmr twelve zero zero
im not sure i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
yeah
there she is definite 99plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations itll spiral in toward its sun and 
i can tell the damn thing just doesnt understand
whats he doin
the key
no no the key the key to the fail safe lock
wheres the failsafe key
where is it what did you do with it
the key goddamit the key
where is the key
it didnt go off
it didnt go off
weve got to disarm the bomb
what was that i didnt hear
what the hell
pinback i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
well now what what do you have for us now boiler
find me something i dont care where it is
fuck that shit
its a goddamn wild goose chase remember when commander powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud
remember what we found fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it remember
hey doolittle heres one an unstable planet 85 probability of an unstable planet in the veil nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star
why doesnt talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
quantum is up thirtyfive
rechannel all safety relays 
talby talby can you read me
well bomb we have about sixty seconds to drop just wondering if everything is all right have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
swell lets synchronize detonation time do you know when youre supposed to go off
all right i have detonation time at wait a minute somethings wrong with the clock  all right i have detonation time at no that cant be right it says three years  okay i have six minutes exactly does that check out down there
armed
thanks
fail safe in lock four minutes to drop 22 minutes to detonation this is sergeant pinback calling bomb 20 do you read me bomb
one hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
do you remember the detonation time
right that synchronizes here okay bomb arm yourself
everything sounds fine bomb dropping you off in sixty seconds good luck
but you cant explode in the bomb bay its foolish youll kill us all theres no reason for it
you wont consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
you are false data
therefore i shall ignore you
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you
the only thing which exists is myself
snap out of it bomb
hey bomb
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb 20 i repeat previous order you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay do you understand
bomb this is doolittle you are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay disarm yourself this is an order
hello bomb are you with me
are you willing to entertain a few concepts
well of course i exist
it is intuitively obvious
hmm well i think therefore i am
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
this is fun
what im getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data and this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center
exactly
thats it
why dont you have more time
now bomb consider this next question very carefully what is your one purpose in life
and you can only do it once right
and you wouldnt want to explode on the basis of false data would you
well then youve already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
thats all beside the point the concepts are valid wherever they originate
so if you detonate in
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
ah whatd you say pinback
ah what was that again i still cant hear you
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction
pinback
your ghf reading is minus fifteen
yes
in a second
new star  hey guess what i got a new star on the readout
another unknown not on the charts a red dwarf
yeah eight it says here
what are you gonna name it
the new star what are you gonna name it
commander powell would have named it
come on doolittle give it a name
wha
hey doolittle think well ever find real intelligent life out there
veil nebula
mark at 54321drop
 open circuit breakers 
 automatic channels open 
im coming in now im down by the emergency air lock too much trouble to come in the ventral lock would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so i can come in
hello pinback are you there
talby
i need a diameter approximation
you know talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us you spend too much time up here
must get lonely being up here so much
should spend some time below see more of the rest of the ship
youll have plenty of time for that you know figure it this way twenty years in space and weve only aged three so therell be plenty of time to stare around
phoenix asteroids never heard of em
you know what i think about talby
its funny but i kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
i cant talk to the others but with time to myself i think about back home back home at malibu i used to surf a lot talby i used to be a great surfer
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit
waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water ridin the wall just perfect
ah doolittle i do have a malfunction on this readout but i cant seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important
lieutenant doolittle this is talby lieutenant
sorry to interrupt your lunch sir but im in the computer room and i think ive located the malfunction the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser down by the emergency air lock cant pinpoint it exactly but im going down there with a starsuit and try to find it
ah lieutenant doolittle sir
ah well i think ive found the malfunction sir im in the emergency air lock
doolittle help me
doolittle doolittle where are you
what happened doolittle
looks like im headed for the planet talby going right toward it
oh yeah
it is doolittle its the phoenix they glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said
im going into them im going to hit them doolittle
before we get too far away and our signals start to fade i just wanted to tell you you were my favorite i really liked you doolittle
commander powell this is doolittle ah theres something serious come up sir and i have to ask you something
commander sir we have a big problem you see the veil nebula bomb bomb number 20 is stuck it wont drop from the bomb bay it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in    less than eleven minutes
whats that sir
well sir the dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
you dont understand sir we cant get the bomb to drop
yes sir negative effect
negative effect
thats correct sir
what should we do sir the time is running out
commander powell commander hello
sorry sir you faded out there for a minute
what were you saying commander about the bomb
commander are you still there
were running out of time sir
sir

these girls kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder  the oldest is twelve  the youngest about the same age you were when you escaped
you are involved  by being alive youre involved
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation  but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden  wasnt sposed to but it did  and its back to the law of the jungle  you got your predators and you got your victims
with your help
that was taken nine years ago idd as michael hanover  sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at rawlins wyoming for armed robbery  he escaped from custody after 4 days  hasnt been seen or heard from since

whoever tossed this place wants you  and im looking to stay outta the line of fire
they lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery  but theres a bug in my computer keyboard a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture

quitting time  grab a cold one
right the big oneoh
hey sketchy
you blew off your girlfriend last night even though it was the big oneoh  id be pissed off too if i was her
i dont see how you cheating on natalie involves me
do guys actually believe their lame self serving excuses
or do you think were just so grateful to have one of you idiots well look the other way which is arrogant and condescending
you left out condescending
here it comes  the part where the guy turns everything around
really
and you were a sympathetic ear
then a sympathetic mouth then a sympathetic
does this person have a name
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way
a toy
fight fire with fire  threaten to go to her husband
what happens if you level with her
and why should she
so youre straight on how this is gonna go down
she tells you how ive been
but you explain that youre a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me
i just dont want natalie to ever find out  she deserves better
convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo
she came by the apartment once already fortunately id disconnected the doorbell as a precaution lydias not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh
max what did i do to deserve a friend like you
you rock max  you rock
no im serious  that psycho got exactly what she deserved yes
shes toxicmonster in bed but toxic
she was the one
true but
okay okay okay
that was extreme  did you see that one guy
this is a hot run  beat it  youre late

dr monnitoff
so according to hawking wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of spacetime
theoretically
a wormhole with an einsteinrosen bridge which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man
like a delorean
what effect do you think this would have on an infant
each vessel travels along a vector path through spacetime along its centre of gravity
beg pardon
uhh sure and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal in this case the wormhole or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered
that is highly unlikely youre talking about an act of god
im not following you
you are contradicting yourself donnie if we could see our destines manifest themselves visually then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies the very fact that this choice exists would mean that all preformed destiny would end
when can i squeeze one out
why do i have to sleep with donnie he stinks
what happens if you tell mom and dad about this samantha
the last unicorn by samantha darko
did you tell them that i flooded the school
thats not what i heard now they think i did it
dea ex machina
how can you do that
why did you make me flood the school
who is we
where did you come from
i want to show you something
you have a request
why are you wearing that stupid man suit
what happened to your eye
why do they call you frank
how much longer is this gonna last
darko cheats death man youre famous i called you like a jillion times last night
my dad said he found you on the golf course are you sleepwalking again
how old is grandma death
whatd you do donnie whatd you do
hey
wanna walk me home
dont look so freaked
so you just moved here
oh i have those too  what kind of problems does your dad have
wow did he go to jail
im sorry i was in jail once  i accidentally burned down this house it was abandoned i got held back in school again cant drive until im eighteen  i think when i grow up i want to be a painter or maybe a writer or maybe both then ill write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book you know change things
i should go for physics monnitoff says i have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind
i mean the whole sanitation thing joseph lister 1895 before antiseptics there was no sanitation especially in medicine
dont knock soap without it disease would spread rapidly if we ran out you and i would never live to see the year 2000
the best thing about soap is that its the only thing on earth that can never get dirty no matter what crap you throw on it it always rubs off and there it is again perfect
its a good thing the school was flooded today
youre weird
that was a compliment
where are we going
where are you going
so when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward like do you dream
its like this big force thats in your brain but sometimes it grows bigger and it spread down into your arms and legs and it just sends you someplace
no every time i wake up somewhere different sometimes my bike is laying there next to me like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge
donnie
do you ever feel as though theres always someone watching you
what happened to your neck
babies cry because theyre afraid of the dark and because they have no memories for all they know every night could be the last forever like perpetual darkness
thats not good enough youve got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them with whatever you wanted
you know weve been going together for a week and a half
well
thats alright i understand
i always wanted it to be at a time when when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be
were moving through time
they suspended me for two days
ive been seeing stuff a lot of really messedup stuff  do you know who grandma death is
oh yeah  the philosophy of time travel what is this
i know shes here she never leaves the house
so we call them imgs
yeah so the idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant and they wear them at night when they sleep
what how long was i asleep
you want to skip fourth period and go to the ridge
will you please talk to me
hey
my mom is gone
i dont know she didnt leave a note the house is all messed up
did you call the cops
im so scared i just keep thinking that something awful has happened its my fucking stepdad i know it
what
come with me
time is running out we have to go see grandma death we have to talk to her
no frank
is that a cellar door
im sorry ms farmer i just dont get this
i just dont get this everything cant be lumped into two categories thats too simple
well life isnt that simple so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet that has nothing to do with either fear or love
people arent that simple
will you still be working at yarn barn cause thats a great place to raise children
youre such a fuckass
oh please tell me elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck
i wish i knew where you went at night  did you toilet paper the johnsons house
you know it would be nice to look at you some time and see my son i dont recognise this person today
grandma death
he cant samantha hes been suspended from afterschool activities donnie are you still with us  how was your therapy session tonight
i have to take the girls to los angeles tomorrow
if im lucky  so i wont be back until the first your dad will be back on sunday so ive put elizabeth in charge until then she has the car so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow
so how was school today
good lord  so the construction guys say itll take about a week to fix the roof damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match
know what
no apparently they cant tell us what happened yet something about a matching serial number that got burned  but i had to sign a form saying i wouldnt talk to anyone about it
oh shit
grandma death
youre right roberta sparrow was famous for her gem collections kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time over the years as she got older she became more and more of a recluse now she just likes to stay up there all by herself
whos been giving you weird looks
youre my only son
donnie darko perhaps given your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion
who is frank
and when the other rabbits hear of fivers vision do they believe him  it could be the death of an entire way of life the end of an era
because the rabbits are us donnie
is the death of one species less tragic than another
ms pomeroy whats going on
where are you going
thats bullshit youre a good teacher
what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you
whats cellar door
cellar door
so will donnie find his cellar door
your mother said that youve been skipping cycles of your medication
so i met a new friend
his name is frank
i think he saved my life
dont you watch the news
frank instructed you to get out of bed just before this happened
follow him where
do you believe that the world is coming to an end
and when i clap my hands twice you will wake up do you understand
so tell me about your day donald
what is her name
do you think a lot about girls
how are things going at school
i asked you about school
what else do you think about during school
who is the boss
what about your family donnie
how many times have you seen frank
can anyone else see him
who is they is frank part of some larger group
a sign from whom
how does that make you feel
is callie still around
id like to believe that im not but ive just never seen any proof so i just choose not to bother with it its like i could spend my whole life thinking about it debating it in my head weighing the pros and cons and in the end i still wouldnt have any proof so i dont even debate it any more because its absurd  i dont want to be alone  so does that make me like an atheist
and they grow out of our stomachs
nothing
yeah but if i told her about the other stuff about frank
whoa  thats ok dr thurman its nothing to be embarrassed about i have sexual fantasies all the time too
i mean gretchen she wont even let me kiss her she says because its our first kiss shes like waiting for this big moment or something i just dont get it i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff
yeah you know  fucking
and when i clap my hands together twice you will wake up do you understand
so your parents why did you disappoint them
people get hurt
people get hurt i dont want to hurt anyone
yes i went to jail
they didnt buy me what i wanted for christmas that year
hungry hungry hippos
regret
that i did it again
yes i flooded my school and i burned down that perverts house i think i only have a few days left before they catch me
i have to obey him because he saved my life he controls me and i have to obey him or ill be left all alone and ill never figure out what all of this means
i think now that he might
because im so horny
i think so i think thats one of the clues its a clue that tells us to keep going
where are we going donald
how is that possible
then how is time travel possible
when will this happen
what is going to happen
i can see him right now
hes right there he can read my mind and hell show me the way out of this the sky is going to open up and then he will reveal himself to me
its too late ive already ruined my life
your medication theyre placebos just pills made out of water
donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god you are an agnostic an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god but does not deny the possibility that god exists
whoa elizabeth a little hostile there maybe you should be the one in therapy then mom and dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts so we wont have to
its called the philosophy of time travel
so i hear you have a girlfriend
whats her name
why would i tell mom
no i dont  she worries about you
its not that i mean mouthing off to your teachers ill admit when dad told me what you said to ms farmer i laughed my ass off
yeah well thats not the way the world works if you keep being too honest the world will eventually find a way to destroy you
i got in im going to harvard
mom and dad wont be back until sunday night its halloween carnival we should throw a party we could totally get away with it
how much are they paying you to be here
gerald
i think you are afraid to ask me for advice i think that you are a very troubled confused young man i think youre searching for answers in all the wrong places
thank you for seeing us we just felt that it was time to discuss
has your son ever told you about frank
frank the giant bunny rabbit
donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination
i what can we do
if thats what you think is necessary
our son just called me a bitch
so let me get this straight no airline will claim ownership of the engine so we have to wait for the faa to decide who fixes my roof  fuck that were taking the money out of savings
what
he was a year ahead of us
i havent been accepted yet mother
excuse me
did you just call me a fuckass
no i took a year off to be with you  of course i care dont get angry  what
i didnt realise it was such a big deal
here are the keys to the taurus theres plenty of groceries in the fridge and i left money on the kitchen table and dont forget
i got twelve classrooms full of water all coming from a busted water main
christ is that an axe
how did this happen
excuse me but what is the real issue here the pta doesnt ban books from school
do you even know who graham greene is
kitty i dont know what to say theyve suspended him for two days  ever since this jet fiasco i honestly dont know what has gotten into him
rose
rose we have a crisis  i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham
please dont say those words  well as you can see many of us are devastated by this news this is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man and i have taken it upon myself to spearhead the jim cunningham defence campaign but unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest which involves you
rose i have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning and as you know the girls also leave for los angeles tomorrow morning now as their coach i was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip
yes and believe me of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you given the predicament with your son but none of the other mothers are able to go
kitty i would appreciate if you could wait
kitty
and how do they do this they flood the house by breaking through the water main

what are your plans then treves you are aware that the london does not accept incurables the rules are quite clear on that point
oh is he a friend of yours
i certainly sympathize with your problem treves why dont you try the british home or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital
good how is the patient
a few words i thought he was imbecile
i really dont think thats necessary treves im quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are
no treves its out of the question now if it was up to me id say certainly lets meet the fellow by all means im sorry i simply cant speak for the other members of the committee
singularly unpleasant chap uh i dont suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient mr treves
shall we say two oclock tomorrow afternoon
two oclock then you know treves it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
its only a physical problem he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth but he can talk and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying just tell me and ill make it clear
as i said its only a physical problem but i do feel that mr merrick is very flattered that youre taking the time and trouble to meet him and hes most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous
yes i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables im afraid that they werent very encouraging but they said theyd bring it up at their next committee meeting so we should have their answers shortly
oh yes
it was a nice try treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words
how did you know the rest i never taught you the rest of it
treves well done
can you imagine what his life has been like
you are quite right treves this is an exceptional case and i quite agree that the committee should see mr merrick
no not that way broadneck and the others dont like to deal with patients directly it makes them queasy do you have any photographs of mr merrick
excellent we shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee i want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities
dont we
has the response picked up
but hes so afraid hes going to be carted off ive promised him that wont happen
dont you think this is a bit premature we dont have the backing yet to
how are you feeling today
im feeling very fit thank you how is your bronchitis
are you comfortable here
i everyone has been very kind to me
everyone has been very kind
what is it treves
it was a great pleasure to meet you mr merrick
how long has this man been here
abominable things these machines one cant reason with them
i say freddie what are you about
good lord freddie what have you got in there
certainly if you insist you must have quite a find there
you never mentioned his mental state
fair katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a ladys ear and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate
an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
what say you fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits
good day
oh no

made by you loki
its a tradition
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald
so did my father and his father before him
but its a responsibility being a berserk
you must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle
were being attacked kill kill kill
i must kill kill
kill kill
hold it hold it in
well of course he is
there thats a true berserk
well go on go berserk
there is nothing we can do
he drove me mad
and his youll never be a berserk if you lose your temper
hes not in valhalla he died of old age
well im certainly not either
well im game
shut up
thorfinn you cant die
youll see my grandfather in valhalla
and youve got both axes
and something to sharpen them with
and dont forget never let your enemy get behind you
and keep your sword greased
and if you have to kill somebody kill them dont stop to think about it
i dont know honey its horrible
maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on just make a clean break
you werent supposed to see that
thanks guys
yeah
im sorry naomi couldnt make it you okay you seem quiet
i remember you turned around your face was dark and your hair was backlit  i could see a halo of frizz  you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me
i remember
yeah you told me that later
who was the girl you walked off with
shit the last time i saw you
but i thought i dont know i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it
and i just liked you so much
no it was lovely
may i help you
ms kruczynski
how are you today
i just thought id say hi i was in the neighborhood

oh baby whats going on
oh tangerine
come up to boston with me
now now i have to go now i have to see the frozen charles now tonight
im so excited yay
i didnt have a chance to wrap it
whats wrong with me
how are you today
well ive been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend i guess
maybe gay isnt the right word but anyway its been rough with him whatever the fuck he is heheh my significant other heh heh and i guess on a certain level i want to break it off but i feel yknow its like this constant questioning and re questioning do i end it should i give it more time im not happy but what do i expect relationships require work you know the drill the thing that i keep coming back to is im not getting any younger i want to have a baby at some point maybe right so then i think i should settle  which is not necessarily the best word  i mean hes a good guy its not really settling then i think maybe im just a victim of movies yknow that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be but then i think no this is what i really want so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it you know agreed but then i think he is a good guy and its complicated yknow
im sorry
why what
really
aw cmon live dangerously take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car
its okay if i sit closer so i dont have to scream not that i dont need to scream sometimes believe me  but i dont want to bug you if youre trying to write or something
i mean its okay if you want to sit down here i didnt mean to 
its okay really
rockville center
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you i thought that earlier in the diner thats why i was looking at you you work at borders right
really because 
 because i go there all the time i dont think i ever saw you before
i dont have one
i noticed your hair i guess it made an impression on me thats why i was pretty sure i recognized you
i like it
yeah tom waits says it in 
i cant remember
i dont really know how 
you think that could possibly be a full time job how many hair colors could there be
im sure you would
you sure that doesnt sound 
oh i doubt thats the case
sorry i was just trying to be nice
my names clementine by the way
no jokes about my name oh you wouldnt do that youre trying to be nice
huckleberry hound
huckleberry hound what are you nuts
oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin clementine no
yeah although it hardly fits im a vindictive little bitch truth be told
why wouldnt you think that about me
now im nice dont you know any other adjectives theres careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative mumpish
i dont need nice i dont need myself to be it and i dont need anyone else to be it at me
joel its joel right
im sorry i yelled at you was it yelling i cant really tell whatever im a little out of sorts today
my embarrassing admission is i really like that youre nice right now anyway i cant tell from one moment to the next what im going to like but right now im glad you said thats okay to me that was nice of you
oh okay well sure ill just  take care then
hi i could give you a ride if you need
youre sure its cold
its okay
where do you live
well i probably wouldnt say if i were but no
im not a stalker
yeah
look im very sorry i came off sort of nutso im not really
so you like bookstores huh
me too it is rain dogs by the way
the songs 9th and hennepin i spent most of the train ride trying to remember till youre full of rag water and bitters and blue ruinand you spill outover the side to anyone wholl listen remember
remember and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept thereand im lost in the windowi hide on the stairwayi hang in the curtaini sleep in your hat  oh shit im so stupid sorry
thanks very much that was very nice of you
take care
um 
you like that
thanks that was good that crow sound
i dont know
frost
its pretty
god that feels so fucking good take yours off
ready for another
what do you want to hear
you just say im not really 
well i should probably get going
no i 
thanks
yknow im sort of psychic
well i go to a psychic and shes always telling me im psychic she should know do you believe in that stuff
me neither but sometimes i have premonitions so i dont know maybe thats just coincidence right yknow you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it yknow
exactly exactly thats exactly my feeling about it its hard to know like okay but how many times do i think something and it doesnt happen thats what youre saying right you forget about those times right
but i think i am i like to think i am
sorry my life isnt that interesting i go to work i go home i dont know what to say
youre really nice im sorry i yelled at you before about it god im an idiot
i like you thats the thing about my psychic thing i think thats my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people my problem is i never trust it but i get it and with you i get that youre a really good guy
and anyway you sell yourself short i can tell theres a lot of stuff going on in your brain i can tell my goal can i tell you my goal
whats the goal joel  my goal joel is to just let it flow through me do you know what i mean its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think were all taught we should be consistent yknow you love someone  thats it forever you choose to do something with your life  thats it thats what you do its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through and my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing you know
like i wanted to talk to you i didnt need any more reason to do it who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist
youre very nice god i have to stop saying that youre nervous around me huh
im nervous you dont need to be nervous around me though i like you do you think im repulsively fat
well for the last week anyway hes kind of a kid kind of a goofball but hes really stuck on me which is flattering who wouldnt like that and hes like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart hes the one who gave me that crow photograph
that made me cry but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river it gets frozen this time of year
exactly i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him yknow and thats where psychic stuff comes in like it just isnt right with him yknow
i dont believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things we like the same writers this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to and hes cute its fucked up joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime
ill pack a picnic  a night picnic  night picnics are different  and 
you should stay

a bully moi

well start with your most recent memories and go backwards  there is an emotional core to each of our memories  as we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process  by the time you wake up in the morning all memories weve targeted will have withered and disappeared like a dream upon waking
im sorry you saw one of our notification cards you never should have
we can help you through this why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine
we can help you through this why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about 
what what do you mean
yours
naomi i really value our relationship i hope its possible for us to stay in touch
so whats going on joel

im sorry
oh sweetie it really does cut both ways we were taking each other for granted and 
miss you too  i have been seeing someone for a little while
a religion instructor at columbia a good guy hes a good guy
so you think the dissertation will get published
okay joel i suppose youre right
so im going to get some sleep im glad youre okay
oh hey patrick
oh patrick you didnt want any did you
i love quotes so did winston churchill he actually has a quotation in bartletts about bartletts isnt that trippy
the quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts
definitely
boo
stan cmon
its just yknow i mean
see you later alligator
hey if youre ordering lunch for mierzwiak would you 
its freezing out
yeah  poor guy  have anything to drink
nietzsche beyond good and evil found it my bartletts
yeah i cant wait to tell howard it seems really appropriate
yup
let him go stan i can help
its amazing isnt it such a gift howard gave the world
to let people begin again its beautiful you look at a baby and its so fresh so clean so free and adults theyre like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness hopelessness and howard just makes it go away
its stopped
its not erasing hes off the screen
i dont know what to do i dont know what to do crap crap
i dont know i just said that
no way i can handle this
hes coming
hey
i swear
it was here at his car i was coming back from a job and spotted you together you seemed caught i waved you giggled
and after that
i really like you mary you know that
you were in red that red sweater with the little flowers i think you were leaning against his car  he looked a little like a kid kind of goofy and wideeyed id never seen him look like that before happy you looked beautiful you looked in love
oh
what do you want stan
whats this
i know what it is
i dont know i just  there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office
mary people come to him voluntarily
the office is filled with people who want their memories reerased
howard your one oclock
mary
order me a pastrami for after
thanks
okay were back in
do you like quotes howard
oh um like famous quotes i find reading them inspirational to me and in my reading ive come across some i thought you might like too
okay um theres one that goes blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders
yeah yeah it is howard and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didnt know
theres another one i like i read its by pope alexander
yes shit oops sorry  sorry its just i told myself i wasnt going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it like i psyched myself out
thats lovely
its fine mary im happy to hear it
ive loved you for a very long time im sorry i shouldnt have said that
we cant do this
what howard
thanks  so do we talk about this or what
do you love me did you love me something i listened to my tape i cant believe ive been sitting right in front of it for a year its like listening to someone elses story i mean i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i cant even imagine you naked i cant even say naked to you
you made me have an abortion
you made me have you erased i loved you i love you how could you 
stan whats going on
okay what happened right before he disappeared
well where was patrick
jesus all right whats the address
ah your journal this will be invaluable
mary what are you doing here
i tried that already
you get some sleep howard ill take it from here
howard theyve disappeared again
ill go out for a smoke if no one minds
so ive got to drop the van off
she should not have done this stan as mad as she was as justifiably 
mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people
oh hi
i think hes in a conference unfortunately im really sorry
this book  its essential that people read it because    its the truth and only i know it
the voltage looks fine
does that help
its an apartment
patrick lets just get through this we have a long night ahead of us
yeah
i like mary i like when she comes to visit i just dont think she likes me
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over too i have a girlfriend now
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend
the thing is my situation is a little weird my girlfriend situation
i gotta tell you something i kind of fell in love with her last night
she was beautiful so sweet and funky and voluptuous i kind of stole a pair of her panties is what
mary hates me ive never been popular with the ladies
whats your bartletts
hold on let me ask my friend  stan can i leave for a little while my girlfriend is very 
i can handle it hes pretty much on autopilot anyway
im a friend of bonanza jellybeans
oh well theres been some trouble on the ranch i came up here to get out of the way its so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down if you could help
but i dont know how to polka
what was that
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe  ha ha ho ho and hee hee
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japaneseamerican i had been put there and watched over i found refuge with the clock people who discovered me in a snow bank near dead i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains
what do you believe in then
is everything getting worse
i want to go back to the clock people i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what theyre up to whats happened to jelly
but thats an old story now i cant believe that you would leave the butte
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics all in siwash cave in a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools it would have to rely on its wits and its senses it would have to live with animals  and plants  as virtual equals its extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve
where do you live miss hankshaw
i know but where do you reside when you arent visiting new york
you dont
a traveler eh
where are the others
welcome podner by god its great to have you here its an honor sorry i took so long getting to you but weve had a mess of hard work these past few days  and a heap of planning to do
no im afraid that part isnt true jack was in awe of me and tracked me down we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover besides i always travel alone
tell me about it
about being a cowgirl whats it all about when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
youre political then
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth its not original its something i picked up from the chink
delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision hasnt happened niwetkame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools tension cowgirl tension what a drag
debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they mustnt resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age shes a real dreamer that debbiedear
thats jellybean
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess
hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but im not in this for whooping cranes im in it for cowgirls if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise i want a finer fate than that  for me and for every other cowgirl better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised
no i guess not
every time i tell you that i love you you flinch but thats your problem
extraordinary
oh you im not talking about her hands theyre difficult to ignore i confess but im speaking of her whole being her whole being is extraordinary the way she talks for example shes so articulate
countess im really in a dither shes turned my head
i think shes disappointed that im not more ah sort of atavistic shes got some naive sentimental notions about indians im sure she liked me though but then she left town
how does she like what in bed
what do you think
shit o dear julian do you mean to tell me you didnt get it on
whose fault was that
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools anyway strap you down and pump the nature out of you they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck why send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all hed be fit for would be a desk in the militaryindustrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy jesus hms christ if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters theyd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps oogie boogie
chinks the guys name for christs sake
im cold
what are you doing
but i dont want you to leave please stay we can go to dinner i owe you a dinner and tonight we can really make love
why why do you have to go
going north
thanks
are you in show business
for magazines
so now youre bummin around
hitchhiking
youre the best
whooee
to my own special sissy cheers and welcome so my letter brought ya flying eh where were you salt lake city la conner well i may have a little surprise for you but first tell me about yourself its been six months hasnt it in some circles thats half a year how are you
thats the very first time in the eons that ive known you that ive ever heard you complain and now youre tired poor darling
freak schmeek most of us are freaks in one way or another try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and youll see what i mean
shit o goodness you wont be thirty for another year and youre more beautiful than ever
you were the yoni yum girl from lets see  from nineteen sixtyeight through nineteen seventy youve always smelled so nice like a little sister the irony has just killed me you the dew girl one of the few girls who doesnt need dew i loath the stink of females they are so sweet the way god made them then they start fooling around with men and soon theyre stinking like rotten mushrooms like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool like a tuna fishs retirement party they all stink from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean they stink
shes a young thing who works on my ranch real name is sally jones or something wooden like that shes cute as a hot fudge taco and of course it takes verve to change ones name so charmingly but she stinks like a slut just the same
sissy sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways the countess has arranged a job for you and what a job
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
if you dont want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him
but countess
but here you are still a virgin  you are virginal yet arent you
yes well what im getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity she cant wait too long you know now theres no reason why you must lose yours i mean just ponder it a bit thats all
i cant be certain that you would but what have you got to lose
sissy dont play dumb with me youre a good model but a shitty actress the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance you know perfectly well they are last seen in nebraska didnt make it to canada siwash lake is between nebraska and canada the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake and who else but jellybeans wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds how much do you know about it have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
ballast
that means topsecret cooper
i can see why they sent you along
you still need the rope i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins
do you copy
shit do not do that where the fuck are you
holy shit
time to play spam in the can
okay listen up as you all know by now we have an addition to our crew dr weir this is starck navigation smith pilot justin ships engineer 
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission
from what
come on skipper i already put my shoes on
we have a man down
the containment second containment
but justin
captain miller were ready to repressurize the clark
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before
will it work
you been out there a long time trying to break my record
what
shit smith youre going biblical on me
well have to reroute through the port conduit to the apu
its holding shes holding
solid as a rock  hey smith
damn dr weir dont scare us like that coffee
coffee
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months it seems impossible but in light of the transmission i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
it was like nothing was there and then justin appeared and the core became metal
you werent there i saw it
i dont know what happened to justin
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
is that an offer
whats happening
let me breathe let me breathe
how the bridge is gone
can you shut it down
im gonna activate the emergency beacon
what
hes a rescue technician peters medical technician dj
we havent tested the air yet it could be contaminated
how is he
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity anyone who can should get some sleep
hell live if we ever make it back
of course not justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it just one of those things  i swore id never lose another man i came close today real close
i i tried to go back for him to save him but i couldnt get to him in time the fire have you ever seen fire in zerogravity its like a liquid it slides over everything it was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire and then he was gone  i never told anyone until now but this ship knew dj it knows about the goliath it knows about corrick it knows our secrets it knows what were afraid of  and now youre going to tell me its carbon dioxide
what is it
they thought it said liberatis me save me but its not me its tutemet save yourself
do you hear it right there
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell
dj the clarks gone smith and cooper are dead
please
please kill
whats wrong
whats happening
whats wrong
ive got a pulse hes alive
90 over 50 and falling 
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
you wanted to see me admiral
incredible these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened this isnt some kind of hoax
that ship was lost in deep space seven years ago if the titanic sailed into new york harbor id find it more plausible  houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team investigate the source of the transmission if it really is the event horizon theyll attempt a salvage  we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ships systems for the salvage crew
its against my better judgement but ill run this by the man downstairs youll know my decision by the end of the day
its not that simple  lyle play the recording for dr weir
youre not seriously considering sending him
the official inquiry blamed weirs design for the ships loss
does he know that
he doesnt belong on this mission responsible or not he blames himself hes too close to it  and then theres his wife
i want our best people on this wheres miller
what justin what shows you
what does
its inside and it eats and eats until theres nothing left
oh my god oh my god
is zero thats what the singularity does it folds space so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time after the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal  its called a gravity drive
youve reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side
ive reached another containment door this things huge
everything green on my boards skipper
okay we do it the hard way deck by deck room by room starck deploy the umbilicus i believe youre up for a walk mr justin go get your bonnet on
justin finish your sweep
patch me through to him
i dont want to die
but i cant i gotta get out of here skipper please
this is weir
dr weir you have no experience with salvage procedures
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation dr weir but it doesnt factor into this
since the initial transmission theres been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months theyre been gone seven years
whats the hold up
i put in for a replacement for you but no one
weve got pressure
jesus its huge
that means they didnt abandon ship
peters is right no ones here
i can see the hatch
the blood came from somewhere peters
okay im on the bridge
everythings been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull its intact
i found one
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters
can anybody hear me
peters
peters i want you to go through the ships log see if we cant find some answers
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
thats a negative starck
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us
captain miller i just want to say
captain miller i appreciate this opportunity
ive been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space
it was the ships maiden voyage to test the drive the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters they received the goahead to activate the gravity drive  and the ship vanished from all our scopes no radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind they disappeared without a trace  until now
what does it say
thats the engineering containment and theres the main airlock we can dock there
dr weir i need you on the bridge
once the ship is secured well bring you on board 
youre in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering
i can see that whatre they for
easy peters were okay were okay lets finish the sweep
any survivors
no one
it beats dying mister smith
yes
hold on whats this gravitational distortion
what could cause them  whats in the core
its insane
if it worked
i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits
you have something dr weir
what about it
its 2041
explanation
what the hell is that dr weir
we barely have enough power for life support as it is if we cant stop the drain were not gonna make it
we dont get the power back our airs gonna go bad
were a long way from home and were in a bad place lets not make it worse if anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time
is that your expert opinion the only answer weve had out of you is i dont know
i want to know what caused that noise i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
thats bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all ive heard from you is bullshit
you said this ship creates a gateway
to what where did this ship go where did you send it
where has it been for the past seven years
the other place what is that
were leaving
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship the crew is dead dr weir this ship killed them and now its killing us
maybe youre right but its still my command and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew and i think there is  starck download all the files from the event horizons computers coop smith finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark
what about my ship
you you cant do that
you cant leave she wont let you
i told you she wont let you leave
your eyes
what are you talking about
if you miss me youll blow out the hull youll die too
weir is dead
what are you
you want me to believe youre the devil well i dont thats bullshit
then what what are you tell me
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing
im not asking you to believe me youll see for yourself and so will your crew youre all coming with me
you cant have them go to hell
i dont like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go is the course locked in
jesus
heading threethreefour
we have a lock on the event horizons navigation beacon its in the upper ionosphere were in for some chop
were all on edge smith were a long way out
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
i guess were about to find out keep us slow and steady
weve got some weather
1500 meters were getting too close
proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 were right on top of it were gonna hit
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby
it is now  were locked in
captain miller
do we have enough time for a weld
were losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked in three minutes our atmosphere will be gone we are fucking dead
but
captain miller you copy
ive found a six inch fracture in the outer hull we should be able to repair it and repressurize its gonna take some time
you break all the laws of physics you think there wont be a price you already killed the first crew
sir
thank you
now what
skipper
smith get out of there
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock
where is it where is it
were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready
ion drive will engage in tminus ten minutes
starck why arent you on the bridge
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
somethings wrong with the bioscan
thats an affirmative
everybody okay
it tastes bad
the antennae arrays completely fried weve got no radio no laser no highgain no ones going to be coming to help us
oxygen is not the problem
its building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
i thought of that with the filters from the clark weve got enough breathable air for twenty hours after that wed better be on our way home
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bioreadings of indeterminate origin right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels
i dont know but whatever it is its not the crew
whats the point ill just get the same thing
i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins
maybe one of the original crew
who
miller
i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin
go ahead
youve got to listen
i didnt say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports
if you knew it was impossible then whyd you waste my time
what i want is to survive the next ten hours
miller come in
what
im on my way starck
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
weir cant be alive
weir activated the drive hes sending us to the other place
blow the fucker up
ill do it 
were armed this fuckers ready to blow
weir
first time in a grav couch
dont worry about it hes hard but hes fair youre lucky to be shipping out with him hes one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach
he served on the goliath
claire
heres another one theyre all over the place
dr weir whats this the door to
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that
can you see a body
no i saw nothing
about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were 
theres no one in the corridor but us
hes engaged the override
yes yes justin we heard it
almost got it
we have to do something oh god
you got any coffee
hey
where is she
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
foredecks crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area can we move in closer
what the hell is that
the safety circuits failed
what
i didnt see anything and i dont have to see anything this ship is fucked
i cant believe this i havent gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit why not mars cap mars has women
30 hours to neptune orbit
you cant do that
this is us aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read this is the lewis and clark hailing 
if they are theyre screening their calls
the scope is lit its right in front of us
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off
what happened to his eyes
miller do you read me peters 
what if the air has gone bad we cant wear these suits forever
relativity yes we cant break the law of relativity but we can go around it the ship doesnt really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another light years away
a straight line
the reactors still hot weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious
could it be the crew if they were in suspended animation wouldnt that effect the scan
what is it
what is it
thats how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black holes immense gravitational power to create the gateway thats how the event horizon travels faster than light
why dr weir i think youre in love
claire is your wife
it must be hard being so far away from her
maybe a power interruption crashed the system
what are you doing
in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset
what is it
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean
i dont think shes real big on hate
such a sad face you know sometimes being different isnt a bad thing
howd you know it was me
im not really dressed for a party
those yours too
were going to have to work on your touch
you know you coulda run an ad in the personals
you dont know what its like out there walking around like some kind of circus freak people staring whispering 
i mean
way to not overthink it  so when do we leave
i can handle the ship i can even handle mr blonde ambition but i dont know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits who the hell came up with them
we can monitor the clouds approach and observe the tests from here
i can only stay for one drink ben ive got to meet with victor
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped
you look like an eighties rock band
he didnt
he didnt mean it you know johnny hes always been a hothead 
just give reed a little more time you know how he works  analyzing every little step before he takes one 
where is reed
what are you doing here
about me how sweet
ben come in
what do you want vic
reed said itd be weeks till 
he couldnt generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass yet another mistake for mr fantastic
ill be watching over you
soon as im back im gonna trade that in for a bigger rock
deb its me i need you to step out front
ben
oh my ggg what did you do to ben
what did you wish for honey
good thing it aint workin reed what are we doing here this guys fastfood stripmall science 
hes financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century
i cant take this
what about his first born
he knew about nasa what if he made the call to shut us down 
maybe you should think about yourself for once you always let this guy push you round 
cant do it i cannot do it
no i cannot take orders from that underwear model that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator
they crashed it into a wall a flight simulator
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do
i had it at four
isnt that your speech
this is your dream reed you should be the one up there
the shields on the station should protect us
i aint done arranging your flowers egghead
how long was i out
i dont know i just keep going over and over the numbers
you go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life
what come on shes got a good thing with victor 
hes smart powerful successful 
are you alright
what the 
we had a tough year
you got a chisel round here
okay ive uh got some questions from sue that she thought might be better coming from me can you you know go to the bathroom like normal
ben im afraid ive got to ask 
its about to be a broken face
ben 
were working as hard as we can 
glad nothing could take you away from your work
time for your lesson vic chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal  ben
ben ive been crunching the numbers on the machine i think if we can rework the power settings
what the hell you smiling at just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those smbs 
if you behave maybe next time daddyll let you drive
please tell me your dawgs not trying to rekindle things with my sister
yeah well his eyes say different
lets see you got victor stud of the year more coin than god or reed the worlds dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp hmmm its a tossup
where where am i
reed sue
whats wrong with me
they said thats not such a good idea the shock alone could 
hey thats a prototype
the machine works and vics gone mister hyde on us 
no more cracks about how i look
your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing every system is still functioning somehow 
i dont really know a compound organicmetallic alloy stronger than titanium or carbon steel harder than diamonds 
at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks 
what
but this disease is progressive degenerative
and where do we think were going
youre hot
i mean you feel a little feverish
my shift ends at four but i couldnt 
me likey
i though we went over this
youre on fire
victors right johnny get to the command center close the shields
hes not responsive 
now what is up with that
oh you dawg you better not be my nurse
this is wrong in so many ways
ben grimm is a genuine american hero whos been through a terrible orde
twenty from outside the place looks a lot taller
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
back it down johnny
not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to earths atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it
is there something about flames about flaming that you 
what no im trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
hes right these costumes are missing something i cant put my finger on it 
thats what im trying to calculate and its not rubber its muscle tendon i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to 
you need to control yourself and think before you 
johnny supernova
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to 
apparently i can disappear
flame on flame off flame on flame off 
stop it
what is that thing
wait you mean theres chance we could be fullon247fantastic
youre really cramping my style here
sweet
uh we call my sister the invisible girl the invisible girl
im driving
youre gonna pay for that pebbles  what
you two need a timeout
johnny did you see ben
is that what you call it real
johnny slow down think you know mom didnt raise us to 
im sorry sis for leaving you guys 
what are you doing 
if reeds right then this little trip will double our stock offering
theyre ready for you sir
our numbers are through the roof the ipos tracking at fifty sixty a share the banks five times oversubscribed 
then what is it
leonard hows the feed
hows the ipo
reeds disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
get me on the am shows larry king cover of the journal  ive got to do something about this scar make sure they only shoot my right side
you know maybe you should get some rest 
sir ive always wondered why sue you could have any woman in the world but 
make sure you find ben bring him back here and keep it quiet i dont need this to hit the press
front page
youre youve i mean how have you bee
those solar winds are flaring but i factored them into my coordinates and 
well uh based on our history you can handle the biogenetics and ill focus on the molecular physics or uhm maybe i should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho
i uh think i remember the number
as far as crew i was hoping ben could pilot the mission 
material made from selfregulating unstable molecules ive been working on a formula for this
feeling better
thats good thats uh good
youre happy for me and victor
which was
for science
uh sue i cant
it has to be the cloud its fundamentally altered our dna
what
sue your clothes lose them
how come ben cant turn it on and off like us
its not invisibility per se youre bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field thats what you projected on the bridge
you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better 
im saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger can you remember the exact emotions when 
okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or
im sorry im sorry i didnt mean to do that you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or 
i mean you broke up with me right
reed i was ready for the next step you werent ergo i walked
there were a lot of variables to consider 
what are you doing
if we can build a machine to recreate the storm we can reverse the polarity 
but were the focus right reed reed
and you sure you can control this thing last time didnt work out so well
reed how close are we to a cure
dont let victor push you into making a mistake 
which is why im working twenty hours a day checking every variable 
i could get ben to tap into the baxters main power to generate enough voltage 
remember our first date here god i was so nervous
you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you speak his mind one who wasnt afraid to tell you what he wanted
when i walked out i waited ten minutes outside your door ten waiting for you to come find me
i can make it work
the power i need more power to control the storm 
sue i need some of that anger rage frustration 
i found a broken gasket from space 
but dreams dont pay the bills do they  same old reed the hopeless optimist still reaching for the stars with the world on your back
this isnt going to be a problem is it
you back this mission and ill sign over a fair percentage of any applications or 
funny how things turn out isnt it
got it so take a walk ben im going to borrow susan for a second
weve got minutes until it hits not hours victor that storms deadly  the radiations lethal we need to abort
bens still out there 
come on ben come on
not until ben is back inside
just a little banged up a couple scrapes why
ben did this
im starting to wonder the same thing how much do you know about what happened to you
didnt go as planned it was a catastrophe you ruined the lives of four people 
abort reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool 
what are you doing here
but im not done with the machine 
its just business
surprised i agreed to reeds proposal
its been a good two years victor the companys accomplished so much
uh victor i hope i havent done something to make you think
what are you doing
whats going on
victor im sorry i 
victor your scar 
im sorry i didnt get a chance to 
you said it was urgent
victor wait slow down a second i want you to know i appreciate everything youve done for me but i just dont 
hes working round the clock but the data needs to be tested analyzed before 
if these molecules arent stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us
please dont make this personal 
scuse me
if youre trying to cheer me up youre doing a helluva job 
reeds gonna fix me up

lust for life its the story of vincent van gough

stacy what are you waiting for youre fifteen i did it when i was thirteen its no huge thing its just sex if you dont one of the other girls will
i cant believe i start high school tomorrow
i hear some surfer pulled a knife on mr hand this morning
linda that girl looks just like pat benatar

like you know giving blow jobs
well i never did it
just kidding about 10cc
was it great
youll always remember your first time
so tell me do you like ron is it serious
there theres his car i know hes at work tonight he hasnt come into swensons since he called my house my mother told him i was still at high school after i told him i was nineteen i guess i should tell him im fifteen
does doug care that youre seventeen
if he ever calls again ill say im eighteen
youve got to get used to working christmas people are always screaming and yelling then they get home and theyre all christmasy
i guess ron hasnt called yet
dont you think it meant anything to him even if i am fifteen
i should quit this job im going to get so fat working here nobody will ever take me out
what do you think of that guy who works at the theatre you know mark ratner
i sent a letter to doug today ill be so glad when he gets out here
listen to this what are your mates three most erogenous zones
wouldnt penis and balls be the same category
all right heres another one the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together
does that ever happen
how long does doug take
whats doug do in chicago
what do you think
i didnt ask for any help did you linda
god he hardly even talks anymore
stacy ive got water in my ears do you have any qtips
god stacy its not that sad its just david soul and ricardo montalban
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks
what do you think it is
it couldnt be
of course it was damone if it was ron johnson youd be out to here
you know theres one thing you didnt tell me about guys
you didnt tell me that they can be so nice so great but then you sleep with them and they start acting like theyre five years old
i really thought he would show up i waited and waited and waited
then i called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father
i paid for it and everything
dont do anything linda id rather just forget about it i dont even like the guy
another summer of working at swensons

what confused us was dr gonzos signature on the telegram from los angeles when we knew he was right here in the hotel
tell me when will the doctor be awake
well the manager mr heem would like to meet him nothing unusual mr heem likes to meet all our large accounts put them on a personal basis just a chat and a handshake you understand
but he will be available perhaps later this morning
theres no hurry the race is over

certainly mr duke
oh and could i get a quart of wild turkey two fifths of baccardi and a nights worth of ice delivered to my room please
whats the message my light is blinking
mr duke hello mr duke im sorry we were cut off a moment ago i thought i should call again because i was wondering

jesus christ i knew you were sick but i never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff
no stop talking like that
you filthy bastard i should cave your fucking head in
no i felt sorry for the girl i wanted to help her
the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards but it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect my attorney
what what kind of goddamn monster are you
okay lucy its time to go meet barbra
i gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe also i told him id be there myself in an hour and if she wasnt id come back out here and rip his lungs out
as your attorney i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline
i saw these bastards in easy rider but i didnt believe they were real not like this not hundreds of them
man i know these people in my goddamn blood
this is a fucking nightmare
read the newspapers
hell in malibu alone these goddamn satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day all they want is the blood theyll take people right off the street if they have to
what could they do the guy that took the head was about sixseven and maybe threehundred pounds he was packing two lugers and the others had m16s
like big lizards
yeh naked except for the weapons
whats wrong with you hell somebody has to do it
sure its all on the qt but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line
sometimes its easier to just rip out the backstraps
good work  theyll treat us like goddamn lepers after that
no shes looking for you
ok goddamnit look ill call her ill get her off our backs youre right shes my problem
what is this
adrenochrome
i remember slumping on the bed his performance had given me a bad jolt for a moment i thought his mind had snapped  that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies but the room was quiet again
never mind its absolutely pure
i know but the guy didnt have any cash to pay me hes one of these satanism freaks he offered me human blood  said it would take me higher than ive ever been in my life  i thought he was kidding so i told him id just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome  or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on
why not we should get some of that just eat a big handful and see what happens
extract of pineal
man your head would swell up like a watermelon youd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours
grow claws bleeding warts
man ill try about anything but id never touch a pineal gland
so do we lady

madam
oh my god frances im such a cad i cant go through with this my wife is in europe but this is her house  her bedroom i cant ask you to
okay but come here first
the group is more than a theatre company its the embodiment of an ideal our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense a creative individual and an instrument of change you see 
forgive my indulgence seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy the point is mr odets here has written a wonderful play most of the roles are cast but we havent found our female lead
not only an artist but an instrument of change we must look to the world around us not content to observe but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy we contribute our profits for if fascism is not stopped in spain it will spread across europe jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive  the artist to be vital must be a soldier too

on behalf of the seattle ladies club as a token of our vast admiration 
yes
i dont believe so
no my dear you must be mistaken
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance
thanks are hardly necessary
im glad to see you havent lost your sense of humor
so it seems may we be serious for a moment
oh are you really
do you expect me for one moment to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do
you may discuss my predicament doctor you may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me im not interested i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian
besides i dont want to be what you want to make me
normal average
did you really say that
this whole thing is a joke
no you stay calm doctor but youre finding that difficult arent you  why are you attracted to me perhaps later in some of our more intimate sessions after we know each other a little better  and youve torn my personality to shreds and im weeping and vulnerable  then youll really get your kicks wont you doctor
is there something else
im sorry to keep you waiting the staff review ran over did you enjoy your mothers visit
not at all she brought me my fan mail  i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me but i guess thats the best thing about working in the movies you make so many friends i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasnt a mistake
no what i mean is im just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life thats all
what
i never said oh look thats just a figure of speech she said something funny and i said
im sorry she misunderstood thats all
doctor i hate to break this to you but my mother is a little batty
you what
im sure youll see it my way in the end
huh
i want outta here you understand im ready to get out so you go back there you go back and you tell them to let me out
symington says
and do you think its radical for a man to have a job and feed a family
is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future and the future of your children
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country
i dont know why they even bother shes had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant
i checked the files this one holds the record for shock treatments four hundred seventeen and no end in sight
yeah well you know doctors they sure hate to use that word
you were with him at the end
i longed to be with him but i wanted his final moments to have peace i could see you were a friend to him

ive never been shown a kindness show me one now
nice
im glad you finally came to the door a man shouldnt have to scurry in the shadows

your crime as well as mine
evil  do you believe in evil
why victor why what were you thinking
what of my soul do i have one or was that a part you left out  who were these people of which i am comprised good people bad people
in which part of me did this knowledge reside in these hands in this mind in this heart  and reading and speaking not things learned so much as things remembered
stolen memories stolen and hazy they taunt me in my dreams ive seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her whose woman was this ive seen boys playing splashing about in a stream whose childhood friends were these  who am i
what can i do
friend
like you oh god you dont know what youre asking
and if i consent

nothing still nothing
somethings wrong i know it  ive heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg

what kind of god is he to will this
god took her from us
victor have a care youll make him dizzy
oh do give him here he needs to be comforted and held

fathers so proud

you will  what do you want victor
ive loved you all my life
this feels incestuous
brother and sister still
i wish to be your wife
if only i could but one of us must stay fathers not strong willies just a child who can look after them in your absence who can run the estate
you make me weak
our decision together
i give you my soul
victor i love you
my mind was not playing tricks he was there in the storm gloating over his crimes challenging me to come
ive no choice
do you know this man is there something between you
i thought id never see you again
what sort of task
what of our marriage victor weve had so much tragedy i want this family to live again
we need each other now i need your comfort and strength not separation and solitude
no not tomorrow not next week marry me today
it was misguided and pointless is your answer yes
well leave this afternoon right after the ceremony pack only what you need
yes were in danger here every moment we stay
brother and sister no more
i remember the first time i ever saw you crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side so beautiful even then
victor
its going to ram us
captain i implore you the men are frightened and angry they want your assurance
a warming wind
he died raving about phantoms he was mad poor devil  gather a detail have the body removed from my cabin
im quite serious look at all the charity and clinic work we do up until thirty years ago the concept of vaccine was unheard of
im convinced not by treating symptoms but by diving natures most jealouslyguarded secrets
no but someday
professor
i was just clearing my throat
i am not mad
are you having me on
henry clerval
do you really think im mad
rich old ladies and their daughters
quite a few
the entire school heard it it wasnt something one could miss
what now writing about it in your journal wont help
now youve got him started
yes and thanks to him smallpox has been virtually eliminated ive heard this speech before
only you would think of that
and heres to him everything in moderation frankenstein
they just caught the man who did it
theyll hang him all the same
keep your voice down you dont know what youre saying
youre making a scene
you cant death is gods will
thats blasphemy
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor
victor this has got to stop  nobodys seen you in months you havent attended a single class
we all know how hard you took waldmans death even krempe is sympathetic but it is time to move on it is time to concern yourself with life
how much longer
this is a bad time henry im busy just now what do you want
yes and
thank god your fever broke  slowly now just a sip  ive been worried we might lose you its been touchandgo for a week
we feared cholera turned out to be pneumonia brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm
mine and professor krempes  weve been trading off nursing you in shifts the rest of the time were out working with the cholera victims its his turn for that just now
we catch a few hours sleep where we can usually here at your bedside
its the downandouts i pity most those who cant fend for themselves theyll be dead by the thousands before this is done they dont stand a chance out there
quite a place
for what
what happened up there
are you sure youll be all right
ill be back as soon as ive got her far away and safe well hunt this fiend down together
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave by my hand
yes i took refuge in the barn wouldnt you lost in the storm freezing and wet i was exhausted and could search no longer
i have always loved him
murder willie in my heart he was our child victors and mine such a thing could never have entered my mind
in science the letter of fact is the letter of law our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect someday you may be priests but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse  any questions
philosophical
paracelsus
what is your name
you seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum
professor waldman
krempe has a way of provoking my temper
to say the least i came here to expand my mind but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new
preposterous
electricity
why god alone knows what it means until it has proven value its nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick hardly fit for the classroom
it is a thrilling direction to explore thrilling and dangerous  nature can be wonderful and terrible science is not a realm for the reckless it needs a conscience we must proceed cautiously assess as we go  what i do on my own time is my own business the same holds true for you you wish to expand your mind fine do so you can even join me here if you like but not at the expense of your normal studies
a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty
reconfigure the leads
victor he was trying to be gracious
i tell you what we need my friends forget the symptoms and diseases what we need is a vaccine for death itself
youre awake ive prepared some broth itll help restore you
frostbite gangrene a simple diagnosis
how is it you come to be here
ah an explorer
i heard
creature a human like creature
your men are right to be afraid
youd persist at the cost of your own life the lives of your crew
do you share my madness
we are kindred you and i men of ambition let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man

i didnt want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset but you dont believe in god anymore

boq south side  take a starboard tack out the door
they take you away to san clemente island  half the guys quit when they come back  supposed to be just hellandahalf
can i ask you somethin lieutenant how come youre doing this  i mean were kinda curious
i dont know if theres any single reason  but my father was navy and he had this oldtime recruiting poster in his den  it showed a girl trying on a sailors uniform while saying gee i wish i were a man id join the navy  was maybe 10 years old when i first saw it and even then it felt wrong  made me mad  and i dont think a month has gone by that i havent thought about that poster  gee i wish i were a man
the woman i saw you with
but are there i mean how many
administration ensign blondell
whos  lieuten 
okay but you didnt have to do what you did  not for me
got it
wow
commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill these were supposed to have been discreet test cases 
 and now i got reporters from toadsquat iowa calling my office and askin what i know about this gi jane thing
well seeins how this thing is out you let me handle the rpm  from this point forward i want all press matters coordinated via my office ill be goddamned if im gonna watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one him or the president  this my shade  midnight mahogany cuz im comin dangerously close to lookin like ronald reagan here
awright  hows our girl doin anyway
uh vip security arrangements generally take some time senator
of course but theres more 
yes of course  please have a seat lieutenant
would you care for a beverage  tea
so  were still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this  for integrating the specrecon training  it may not always be smooth but were trying to make it as painless as possible for you
barber was my next stop sir wouldve had it regulation sooner only 
really i have no problem with 
none at this time sir
sir i just want you to know im not here to make a statement  i dont want to make men look foolish all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience  just like everyone else i suspect
pardon the hour sir  but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way
all right lieutenant give me a name and specifics ill have the xo file an action first thing in the morning  a name
oh really
because i was civil now youre complaining
did you just have a brainfart
did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander  if so i regard that as a bonafide brain fart and i resent it when people fart inside my home
what i resent lieutenant is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment  what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men the daycare center i have to build where an officers lounge used to be and the obgyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears  but most of all lieutenant i resent your perfume however subtle it may be competing with the aroma of my fine threedollarandfifty nine cent cigar which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities  does it
no sir what
well  least now were talking the same language  so one standard  is that what youre after
straight up
and if you just happen to wash out i wont have to contend with you bitchin to some hairychested female senator  and please note i did not identify any one in particular
then good night
see me sir
sir i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this  not this article not 
permission to leave sir
i dont know of any delicate way to say this lieutenant so i wont try  claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization  of the samesex variety  specifically that you were   seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming
im saying were just friends
sir please if theres any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud
sir  if tomorrow i was not under your command would the inquiry still go forward
well if you had to go over my head lieutenant thats the way to do it  christ nothin like a 0200 call from the commander and chief to get the bowels movin
aw what is this
ah cmon
fine by me sir
newberry get a photo  south
shit  think were had
i aint gonna shoot her
banditos on the east perimeter  150 yards  shit she was part of it
what were gonna pry em out with paddles
white house boys want a private meeting
think i overplayed it
yes
she made it through sere training  got a call this morning from 
 last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service particularly in the landbased maritime specialties whats more the navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on 
hardly the case senator
the lark report
the navys conclusion regarding the crash of an f14 aboard an aircraft carrier  female aviator it just so happens  youre familiar with this report and its conclusion am i right
yes i see your signature right here  twice the size of everyone elses  and your conclusion was pilot error hmm
the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier
so everyone i talk to says youre top drawer with silk stockings inside
coronado
i know that sir  maam  its just that beggin your pardon senator but do you understand that this involves combat training
captain dwyer  technically
uh question maam
would i be the only one  the only woman
cant complain maam
uh maam
jordan  i always hoped wed get together  though just now im gearing up for a childcare vote that 
you know him
it should  you nominated him for specrecon just three days after you nominated me
did you set me up  did you set me up just to see me fail
wickwire was there to help  to be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot  at least that was the intent
should probably ask him that
so  isnt the president jumping on your bandwagon
you dont know that
what are you saying  that a womens life is more valuable than a mans that a womens death hurts a family more
you were never going to let women serve in combat  you always had a safety net  or thought you did
so the rhetoric gets you headlines but the reality gets you in trouble
i once promised you a fast ticket jordan and i always meant to make good on that  come work for me  i can always use a hardcharger on my team
ive had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began  and thats quite verifiable
youll think about my offer
so she picks the women we pick the programs  seals
then i suggest we start there
what the hell is the president trying to do  steal dehavens thunder
montgomery why do they call you flea
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size
well flea i appreciate the respect you just showed me  but i dont need it and dont want it  not that kind of respect anyway  its just gonna hurt us both okay
hey  you okay flea
really dont wanna be captured el tee  heard some bad things
close as i can get eltee
six oclock  marking marking
dont have to use it oneil but its gotta go out  five four three
just do it okay
come on montgomery
oneil
time
miller  thought the guy was made of depleted uranium  really didnt expect to lose him
boat five  wickwire cozad vinyl intagliata ayers and wise lieutenant wickwire is your senior officer  follow his orders to your death
you dont think shed be raped if she were captured  you dont think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men
ive had it  just because they pay me like a babysitter doesnt mean im gonna be one
shes an officer  theres a higher standard
of course it is  and im gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equalrights thing that real lives are gonna be lost  maybe mine maybe yours
thank you sir  but i like these just fine
ill try anyway sir
automatic fivesecond deduction which slips you under the wire its called gendernorming oneil  standard procedure for all females in physical training courses  where you been the last few years
the navy cross
i was looking for him earlier but
just a coincidence
lieutenant oneil
do we know its him using the beacon  not a decoy
chances of recovery
north korean beaches are the best protected most heavily monitored in the world  the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system  extraction team has to be small and silent  id go with seals over delta force problem is dont want to hold a conventional sub offshore for target practice  wheres the polk
unless you whiskey run
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bareback  is that correct oneil
that was good headwork lieutenant
probably hear back from cnn first
by the way ill need that option paper by 11hundred today so i can review it with admiral hanover  and do we have any of that breakfast tea around here
so whyre you even considering it are you
specrecon  those guys are world class warriors  and they will not want you there jordan
well youre doin shithot at intel
shes haze grey and underway
so dump on me
well guess i dont even need to be here
youre such a ballbreaker sometimes  especially at night
ill try to keep the door open  if you wash out i make it so that 
i dont feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life jordan  maybe we should just let it happen
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth  but im trying to be honest okay  three years is a long time  dont ask me to predict how ill feel then jordan because i dont know  and either do you
jordan
ive been trying you for five days dont they give you messages
that bad
well not this  i was doing the pentagon scene few nights ago  got some fresh stuff  about you  you may be in a hostile camp  i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn
dont you know  how theyre talking about you
so why are you telling me this
you know royce i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too
well let me warm you  im going though with this  the more everybody fucks with me fucks with my head the more it just makes me want to finish  so dont expect me back crying in your arms any time soon okay
still cant make up your mind huh gotta go royce
all i wanted was an honest chance and if i couldnt get it i couldnt stay
maybe  though it didnt seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it  almost like  did i say he was class officer
no shortage of suspects
cmon jordan  do the headwork with me
someone screwed you over like this left unanswered charges hanging over your head and youre not gonna fight back
john james urgayle  the chief
instructors typically pull three year assignments  this guys in and out in one year  your year  that sound right
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy
in washington
wickwire thomas dane second run at coronado and correct they had him stashed in the appropriation liaison office whatever that is
id sure like to know who
so here we are again  staring three years of operational duty in the face
which is guyspeak for
theyre more afraid of you
it was made clear before you came  harassment equals career suicide cant say anything good so they dont say much at all  to your face anyway
it was made clear  anyway stay ballsy  first weeks hell then it levels out  until sere training anyway  thats hellandahalf
made it to week 10 last time
hey  way to gut it out
who is it
wick  they got your crew too
you really came back for more  of this
one time he was doing a rekkie of the libyan coastline  this is like right before we bombed khadaffi into the past tense  so his crew does a nighttime infil maps all the big artillery placements and stuff then turns around to get the hell gone  but between them and the water are five libyan guards all armed to the nuts
nah they were deadass asleep  but on every guards chestthey left one marlboro cigarette  just a little calling card to say theyd been there  and could come back any time they wanted
so the shit you gotta go through to get from here to there  brother said it was worth it  worth the training worth the divorce worth anything
at first
oneil
last time i didnt
sorry didnt mean to 
first big night of liberty and no date  youre pathetic wickwire
i cant go out  not like this
do you uh know
were going over to her place to make salad and pasta  just you know nothing special
im sorry oneil  but as class officer its my obligation to report all violations
whatre you guys doing  huh
she part of the training
if not firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area  now how smart is that
32 feet six inches
cool
so we got two full minitanks three minutes each  cool  how much air in yours
say again sir
chief sir i dont understand why 
permission to get dressed sir
sir someone mentioned you received the navy cross  may i ask what you got it for
i see  so when a man tries to rescue another man hes a hero but when he tries to rescue a woman hes gone soft
females in combat situations impact unit cohesion  men fight better without women around  and that is an historical fact
england went out with a stress fracture  that puts you in charge lieutenant
simple question lieutenant  no reason not to answer  what is your fathers name
any brothers  sisters
are you hungry  whats your favorite food  well try to get it for you
you are in the cage oneil  right here right now
why didnt you shoot the woman oneil
would you have shot if it was a man
the others already told me oneil they wanted to shoot but you wouldnt let them  because you went soft on another women 
thats what your crew said  are they lying  or are you
im not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage  you wear the bars you made the call and you got your whole crew 
do you
didnt you know youd be raped if you were captured  didnt you even think about that
well im trying to figure out if youre stupid unlucky gluttonous  or some new alloy of all three
managed to activate the elb  if you just radio base and let them know theyll fix on that  oh and make sure they send a helo with a winch  doors blocked by a reef  over
say again  how many micks
got it
oneil
well who the shit you think you are  comin in here like that
anybody usin these drawers here
aw lookit this lookit this  shes bringin tampax in here cmon you got nothin but rooms over there
would you just get outta here
clear
all right fireandevade maneuvers drop everything but weapons and the prc radio  were gonna be high speed low drag all the way to the linkup site  ready
i just wonder how that happened
you dont suppose this is just part of
maybe we should call the coast guard
were fucked
cant live with them cant kill them  whats the point
you mind  im trying to eat here
this aint workin right
subject
thought you two were fileclosed
all right  so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way
congress cuts military bleeds  but pentagons a big place  lets narrow the sights
sabotage born of economics wouldnt be a first  but is hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure
the white house  if jordan wins dehaven wins in spades  why  well its been said that the only man the president fears  aint no man
dont for a second think she didnt leak this story  gi jane gives dehaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all
if you were the president wouldnt that put a little piss in your shoes
this aint about some little soldier girl sloggin her way through commando school  the implications go way beyond
i take it this file is still open
okay so now work it from the other end  think about california  and how things might be handled there
thats cuz im married to you
im telling you hes dirt hes a douche bag gutter slime dog crap puke chunks
audreys going to stay with us tonight

so you still picking apart cockroaches
youre still mad at me arent you
that was eight years ago some people change you know
wait im sorry youre right eight years is a long time can i offer you a cup of tea
i still cant believe it how does a guy go from an antinuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect
and you think this creature is one of them
blood sample how close did you get to that thing
hes pregnant
well obviously these tests werent designed for this but fundamentally theyre looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy
the ultimate expression of evolution it reproduces asexually think about it all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction thats why he came to new york like every species of insufficient progenitors hes nesting
is this cause of me because of the story
you never said it was off the record
i didnt mean for it to turn out like this  look i lied to you im not a reporter when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure id make it but i havent thats why i needed this story so bad i just couldnt tell you im a failure
what are you doing here
circuits are overloaded
come on the broadcast booth is right over here
the network is on an intranet its a direct feed into our computer system
if the military are listening they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape
are you okay
youd be surprised
who was that french guy anyway
and im supposed to remind you to call him on all of caimans expense pos
my life sucks
i cant believe he put the moves on me after everything ive done for him

caiman wait take me with you
ive got something on this i know a guy on the inside with the military
you dont understand i can get us information
we did it weve got the exclusive way to go audrey
i want that story audrey remember you work for me
hi nick tatopoulos
three years digging up worms in chernobyl how did mrs tatopoulos handle it
really a girlfriend then
not for a long time now
hence the radiation
evacuate manhattan thats over three million people has that ever been done before
im sorry about all this
make sure they find that nest before its too late
merde
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten
weve secured the doors on both levels
they didnt make it
when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone
only five sir weve checked them all he hasnt used any of them
and how should we do that sir
who are they lieutenant get those people away from there
chargeures property and casualty insurance we are preparing a report
that is our job
major what do you think could have done this
dr niko topopolosis
right the worm guy  can someone get those people off the beach
you didnt answer my question in fact for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions
look i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field
do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworms dna you have any idea what that means
seventeen percent huh sounds big
what sample
that was a footprint i was standing inside a footprint
but theres no animal in the world that can make prints like that is there
somebody must have seen it
the radiation is not an anomaly its the clue this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur
you know hes not an enemy trying to evade you hes just an animal
well yes i did clearly he was injured and bled
no it reproduces asexually thats why we must find the nest if we dont dozens will be born each one capable of laying eggs of its own very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population
you gave them the tape
we think theres a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area
general anderson the problem was the terrain if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park  we should be able to take him down

he always has to make the big entrance
he dissed us again brandon
hi brandon
oh  okay
i have sectors 128  i think hector has the upper levels
commander please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having in the quasar dilemma the sentient had taken control of the ships guidance systems however
commander as i was saying in the quasar dilemma you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix so we were wondering where the error lies
yes but we were wondering
 yes
oh oh i see oh
brandon
yes i know and i want you to know i thought about what you said i know you meant it constructively but
 but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase okay i understand completely that its just a tv show there is no ship there is no beryllium sphere no diagital conveyor i mean obviously its all just a
i knew it i knew it
okay we got it
okay now left at the next turn past the oxygen units  make a right there then go through the antimatter vent
commander do you have a camera  id die to see this in person all they showed on tv was a machine here and a wall here i dont know why they didnt show the whole thing
yes
brandon just in case i die theres something i have to know
what does the omega 13 do

no wait are you
shit go

what  up
im at the control oaneh what do i do
thats it
structural damage at 68 percent
i just cant believe it any of it  look at this room they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from historical document thirty seven  oh and wait wait listen to this  computer
whats the weather like outside
the ship is sustaining structural damage
the enemy is matching velocity
computer what about our engines why dont we have power
negative the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced
negative no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard
systems register functional
systems register functional
u what do you think
 what does that mean
covalent right so
hey commander listen we found some beryllium on a nearby planet we might be able to get there if we reconfigure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion what do you think
a hologram
the digital conveyer  you mean im going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces
no ill kill you 
fred i worked summer stock with hopkins regional theater with hoffman but i swear to god i have never met an actor who could hit his mark or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a freddy kwan youre mr dependable you can do this
as good as hopkins
how do you remember this stuff

the digital conveyor
weve got to get that valve turned off their oxygen is almost gone
its suicide

okay
theyre still behind us
guy youre not going to get killed on the planet okay

maybe we can lose them in that cloud
are they behind us
can it be repaired
do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard
self control  thats funny coming from the guy that slept with every moon princess and terrakian slave girl on the show
youre playing your good side
all right heres the plan  first fred we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound then gwen alex fred and i go down to get the sphere  any of those things come back give a signal guy you set up a perimeter
how does the rolling help actually
clenched jaw
jason can you hear me
thank god are you okay
what  what did he say
wait the pig lizard is gone why are they still chanting for the pig lizard
jason  i dont think the pig lizard was gorignak
so we get to shut down the neutron reactor
uh i hate to break it to you jason but i dont know how to shut down a neutron reactor and unless you took a learning annex course i dont know about im pretty sure you dont know how to shut down a neutron reactor either
theres no hatch  theres no hatch
what is that thing it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk
we shouldnt have to do this  it makes no logical sense why is it here
hes accelerating to mark 6
never doubted you for a second
where the hell is he  an hour and a half late  an hour and a half
youre kidding when for
unbelievable
you gotta admit they do love him
thats it its go time

oh my god tommy stop the pod stop the pod
we got the sphere but the commanders down there with a bunch of cannibals  teb reset the pod were going back
i heard it too
jason  you think you couldget any closer to those mines
tommy look  those lights
first i require the omega 13 second
yes hi sarris how are you doing

accelerate to mark 4 tommy
commander i must speak to you it is a matter of supreme importance we are thermians from the klatu nebula and we require your help i beseech you to come with us back to our ship a great many lives hang in the balance
i certainly but
sir i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol but please i beg you to hear our plea we are thermians from the klatu nebula  our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by rothhar sarris of fatukrey sarris wants the omega 13 we are to meet in negotiation however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous the flames the death  please captain you are our last hope  we have secured a limousine
commander welcome to the protector ii  would you like to don your uniform
commander where are you going
you you mean earth
but commander the negotiation you you you fired on him
theramin
but what if sarris survives
he has a very powerful ship perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
an interstellar vox
how can we thank you commander you you have saved our people
weapons storage
to our brave guests  few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes  we are blessed to count ourselves among them
mathesar  has sarris seen the historical records
then how did he find out about the device
former commander
commander
mathesar what is that
a thousand apologies we have failed you
deception lies
im not a commander there is no national space exploration administration there is no snip
a model only as big as this
sections of rooms made of plywood our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster the digital conveyor was christmas lights decorations  its all a fake  im not him  im a nothing a nobody
the ship is a model as big as this a very clever deception indeed he oant oontaln his lauchter  a belletommy set a course for home lommander
you said we do appearances together or not at all
 to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies and plenty of them
thats right just keep shaking it out here have some gum it helps
whats going on
excuse me
well its this was a device we  discovered on an alien planet  we dont know what it does either
where
faster tommy get us out of here
could be this
do your best tommy
all right gwen alex fred follow me  guy set up the perimeter tommy you keep a lookout make a signal if they come back
anything
oh right sorry
sorry guys it just went off
okay on what
go for the eyes like in episode 22 with
the throat the mouth its vulnerable spots
no no no
all right guys uh gwen and i are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually fred you and guy need to get that air valve back on  alex see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case fred and guy cant get the oxygen back in time
pedal to the metal tommy
lets do it tommy
hold course laredo
continue forward sir
lieutenant lathe i confess i am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself chasing across the universe to obtain what is i am now certain a bauble of fiction tell me how best to obliterate this vessel i would like nothing to remain
find them
enerao ive host them the maanetlsm o the field is disrupting our onstru ait there they are
what wh
some say that hessians are invincible
well now theres something worth dying for  what do you think
unfortunately ill never get the chance  im leaving in an hour for congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion  wasting my time naturally look at her teasing those bumpkins
im accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property
weve got to attack the british now  have they put you in charge yet  do we have an army yet  what is happening
i capture quebec leading an army by river fordings through maine if we dont do it the british will come down champlain take back ticonderoga and attack us in the spring
over three hundred miles
whats your frank estimation of the british
they died well  otherwise they didnt do much right  but if we have war the british will surely send their best troops  right now they have no other enemies
ben franklins going to paris but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns  our troops are mobs they wont take orders have no equipment could they beat the british
arnold
damnit  youve given us a whole new season benedict  and congress thinks that the british are going to ride right over us come spring now half their army is back in canada
why in hell would john do that why in hell would any of them do that  after all youve done its unbelievable
they dont trust me thats the truth isnt it  sam adams never did
were in bad shape benedict moral is low  before i can do anything i need lee and his seven thousand troops  ive ordered him to join us three times  in my last letter i all but begged him to come here the man is insubordinate
go on i want to hear everything
is that a fact
what do you think george shall i resign  its what they want
the army needs you
then i need you  we all do without your victory the men would have no hope at all
i hope i never have to believe that
after visiting congress i know what its like being violated by come disproportionate asses  ah if she only knew that the most important men in the country  possibly the world  are sitting at this table
well george who were you
our plan is to hit them as they leave
theyre ready  believe me the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything  of course we get nothing from congress  they need boots coats we desperately need food
there was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at congress which says i am personally responsible for all our hardships  and that i have encouraged the people of america to make me into a god  benedict it says that i have gone mad
theres this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga
as soon as the men have good shelters ill move  perhaps martha will join me this winter
have you heard  the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee
that scum joseph reed theyre calling him the king of pennsylvania  the mans a budding cromwell  he condemns rich tories to death and then appropriates their property for himself naturally the pig hates me for every tory ive saved
they love reed and his inquisition i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits  its becoming the american way
these men were taken from their homes at night tried by reeds courts  which congress recognizes  and well you can see
colonel sir mrs washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner
you you just need a new flint general
yes general  but if you have to shoot somebody you cant
misunderstood what
what  what are you talking about
me  you apologizing to me
wil
youve served me loyally year after year without complaining ive thought hard about you this past winter  i want to free you wil  i want to give you your freedom after this battle is fought
wil im giving you your freedom do you understand
wil i want to remind you of a conversation we started just before monmouth
well what have you thought
no uniforms  no coats even  in this weather
what sort of boots would you say hes wearing  i should say no sort of boots at all  arent those rags wrapped around his feet  is that what he marched here in
and is that a pitchfork beside him
negroes  washington has black men in his army  are they good fighters  whats that red ribbon on his arm colonel
by red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is colonel
general lee welcome back  im happy youve decided to join us
i am to take command of major general lafayettes division and lead the attack
what the goddamned hell do you think you are doing
who is that
captain alexander hamilton sir
weve got powder but no ball
how old are you captain
ill expect you for dinner this evening captain hamilton  for christs sake have a bath
excuse me general but may i ask how do you feel
im so inclined
general washington is there actually going to be a compromise i mean a deal with england
captain i want you to know that i respect your openness  it would make me happy if youd join our table for dinner from now on
that young school teacher i heard the british hung him as a spy
theyre among the best divisions the british have  no conscripts no impressed recruits just professional killers
i was a clerks apprentice on saint croix  but then i went to kings college
are you going to keep him sir
its impossible to stop these men deserting in winter you might as well stop geese from migrating
what are we going to do
general greene is here  there are two other divisions here
yessir
sir i think no such thing
sir arnold is a traitor
what is this
this is a declaration of insurrection  who wrote this
george remember that night when we were drinking with arnold
he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people  even if it was against congress  george the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america  listen to me the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne  george you must declare yourself with us or against us
whats your advice alexander
i want to address the officers all the officers  next friday  can we arrange it at the mess
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention
george youre the only man the people trust trust with power they know you wont betray them
thats why the people trust you george  without someone at the convention who has the people behind him everything will fail will you do it
horatio  horatio gates of course you know john adams of the massachusetts delegation
the last i heard a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breeds hill  with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it
who the hell knows  everyones giving orders  its all very democratic
well john adams your cousin has a marvelous gift
with your support horatio  as one of our own who has seen combat with the british your opinion counts
you wont be needing his largess rhode island is already committed to your appointment
colonel charles lee hounds and all  quite the character  hes got a tremendous reputation
if he supports the british why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them  unlike general lee who you and congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent
george im sorry  we all know the army will acquit arnold
they are friends of congress
washington is perfect  hes a southerner hes a war hero and hes rich
lets not over do it
makes you gag
oh come now
you think that
no one wants another failure right now god knows  but people like arnold and god knows im having my fears about general washington
partially
i doubt arnold will be afraid
did god ever make such a pitiful army
no officer is going to get these men to fight  they had the life crushed out of them on long island at the most perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost then retire to protect congress
general lee is detained captain
the british army sir
congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army
unofficially general greene
any word from canada
my god they mean to finish us what about arnold  hes up there
if we have any hope for a compromise or truce with england now we have to hold on here  our men must believe they can win  the british must believe that somehow in some mad impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them
colonel reed
that damned arnold is here isnt he  did you know he lost all his ships  outrageous and completely unacceptable
a grand scheme
no  as a matter of fact i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about
what do you mean youre not a christian  of course youre a christian were all christians
but the hessians are there  no one can beat them  thats why cornwallis stationed them there they have the post of honor  they are invincible
george im afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide i see where were headed youre putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold
and hamilton  greene
understand  you need to be listening to people like john adams and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind
gentlemen let me get to the point i cant see the wisdom of pursuing this old courtmartial against general arnold
arnold is indispensable do you understand  i need arnold to help me win this war
however through my relations with members of his majestys court i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england  vive la france  vive lamerique
sir please accept my commission from congress and  you must see this portrait of my beautiful wife adrienne we had the most perfect little baby girl just before i left  her name is henriette
gentlemen my i introduce a french gentleman recently appointed major general by congress  marie joseph paul yves roch gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette general lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen and how many cases of muskets mon petite marquis
continentals congress paper money  it was worthless to start with but as you see counter feiters have made them even less than worthless  can you tell which one is fake
no please an advance on your salary
you must be very rich
charming little victories please dont expect much more of us monsieur
these supplies
and how rusty are these muskets
well we will accept these charming little gifts  when we see them meanwhile please take your pick of a horse
because if the british got off their asses and came up here now we would be smashed  and the revolution would be finished  tell king louis its that bad
like flowers after the snow melts
what is it marquis
my god  who ordered this retreat
i feel the same sir
its another demonstration against the king  this is the wildest yet
surely you knew this was coming
our beloved father the king also refuses to bend
of course if it were that simple  these people  theyre after something else
well a very real expectation is the british will hang you  theyll burn mount vernon and theyll hang you  our marriage is a business just as surely as
i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated to be destroyed
the day tom jefferson frees a slave ill ride naked through the streets of williamsburg on a mule  tom jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small  the only man out there who really does what he says is sam adams and everyone thinks hes crazy  believe me this disturbance isnt going to last long  you have to understand congress is a chicken coop full of foxes martha each and every one has his eye on a nice fat prize
but as usual it will not go well for them  martha you must trust me
liberty virtue country thats from cato you know that play about the noble romans  as i was riding up to philadelphia i found myself thinking about the old days
when i was a young man we used to recite cato we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven  devotion to country duty purity of heart purity of heart  i was drunk on something then
thats right
did you know that jefferson has proposed a law in virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church
its an antichristian dogma  i cannot believe you are so calm about it
martha what
to win this war i need an army
whats the point of a revolution if it doesnt
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men its damned condescending
well we must keep in mind the dower laws  one third of everything we have is mine and since our negroes have been interbreeding it would be legally impossible to distinguish them
leave me now sir i am tired
not today
we cant take them  are you all right
theyre finished they cant help us anymore  theyve done their duty general greene now you do yours
colonel washington  colonel nathanael greene rhode island militia
i im possessed of the idea of a command in your army sir
but you do come from a military family
a horseshoer
the only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them fifty lashes each
nathanael someone bred to station bred to being a gentleman  unlike these men  his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs
i certainly didnt mean you  of course you are a gentleman an officer and a gentleman
general greene
theyre just disgusting jealous bottomfeeding swine  its their nature
sir if you dont mind my saying i dont understand your history at all  i mean why would you want to win the war  youre not after glory like benedict  youre a slave owner and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army
no  were all of us after something  its easy for me to fight for the common man  my father could only dream that i would be a general someday  and what of my daughter or son  i know what im after  but now with all this talk about compromise  it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope
at one time i could have chosen not to be
what the hell are we doing
nathanael im sending you to virginia to head the southern army to harass cornwallis  marquis you must go with him
sir i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform
well this must be about something
if the constitution is ratified well have a country  theyll want to elect you president of the convention which means president of the country
well the widow curtis will bring you riches position land even halfgrown children  you wont have to do anything at all  you shant have to do another thing to prove yourself
george you know i only love you but
and what is this then  been off to fight the french because you are a patriot  or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war
is it  william says now you have requested a british commission why not colonial  ill clear it up for you sir because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels  more than that it will even get you into polite society your dream come true george the only dream that really matters to you
now that is a lie  see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet  when you break off your engagement to martha curtis ill divorce william  do you hear  you get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love
you remember george when we were studying the great philosophers
well i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements but which i now see means us all
so you are williams wild young neighbor  or should i say brother william claims you as a member of his family  i have heard so many unflattering tales about you and i understand that except for you this family is quite cultivated
oh but you must not mind my talking about you  in fact william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest english gentleman out of you
we can grow three primary crops in a season and if we have some luck we get a forth  the temperature is generally mild
think what the play means william perhaps these words have a place in the real world
where do those men come from george
africa  thats so far  how do they get here
capture them  well ive never seen anything like it so of course im curious
the word minuet finds its source in minitus which is latin meaning small or orderly
cranes  who needs to walk like a crane
what do you really think of the minuet anyway
then why are you teaching me
i always though london was the place to be  capital of the world the most spectacular city on earth
do you  when i saw those men yesterday in the field and the women and children in those hovels im not so sure if america is as far from england as id hoped
is it  well im scared of what weve become in our freedom
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them
i dont laugh at you george  i like you  i like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat and thats because youre completely incompetent at hiding your feelings
what are you doing
youre out of your mind
they can use their imaginations
ive been surprised in an unguarded hour but must not now go back the love that lay half smothered in my breast has broke through all its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre  i cannot if i would conceal it from thee
remember george it is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong
you are a slave owner  you have been illegally surveying lands beyond the ohio valley  that land belongs to the natives
all people have rights
yes
i say
and others say have you even read locke vattel voltaire diderot
you hear that
is that your test of patriotism george if a man will die for you
the land here is best for grain and corn
my daughter i ask only
for god sake get that horrid stuff off your face  you look like a damned slave  its damned humiliating
william weve been studying hard i really know my stuff
what is this
i reserved a cadillac
youre kidding me right
shit now someones gotta climb down there and get him
cat thats the lamest idea ive ever heard
and i mean high up in it  thats why harrys gonna make mr lovejoy with me not chili palmer
doesnt matter what its called harrys got martin weir and its gonna be big
he knew it was a set up he was ready for it
i guess still in the locker
you see the paper
his foot jeez poor ronnie

bear the colombians are in la seems they all upset about their money that aint enough as a bonus it turns out the yoyo was escobars nephew
hes gonna pleadeal his way out give up this ace stunt man now one of the west coast dope kings if they go easy on the cat
i heard in the federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your daddy on fathers day
after this one im out cat you understand this is the last time we talk to each other
what about him
and if we dont happen to find it under palmers mattress or inside karen flores undie drawer what then
you get the money
trade for what
you get life for kidnapping
hell why not just shoot her why not shoot everybody fuckin shoot me shoot the fuckin president
and thats for the airport

hey chil since youre goin out to la anyway
guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand sixty days over a movie producer
jesus if i have a heart attack i hope you know what to do

dick allens a very dear friend of mine how far you want to go with this
operator how do i get las vegas information
a markers like a check harry
youre not looking at me harry
i want you to
come on harry  mesas the worst they might do is get a judgment against you uttering a bad check i cant imagine you want that to happen man in your position
you make movies huh
karen say hello to chili palmer chili this is karen flores
you want to hear this idea its about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand go on tell her
its the kind of situation you dont pay you get your legs broken
without him the guys so out of it he doesnt even know its gone
keep going
so he comes to la
thats it thats your movie
thats half a movie with holes in it maybe forty minutes of screen time you dont even have a girl a female lead and on top of that theres no one to sympathize with you dont have a good guy
part of it yeah
you mean leo
im not the guy harry
im out here looking for leo i just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend dick allen
is that right thats what you do for a living
i imagine in your line of work there were times you had to get rough you know say one of your customers stopped paying
you pack a gun
what does that mean
ever shot anybody
really you ever been arrested
these guys my investors they run a limo service came to me originally put money in a few of my pictures and did okay theyre happy so they come in on another deal  this was back a few months ago when i was planning what would be my next picture about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake the characters theres this seven hundredpound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys gets them in her trailer 
youre trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid and thats hard to do lets just get to where youre at okay you blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in vegas on a basketball game and you havent told em about it why not
you got that on the brain harry if youre so scared of em whyd you take their money to vegas to begin with
for a movie
whats it called
mr lovejoy thats the title
murray saffrin guy who wrote it did all my grotesque pictures had it in a drawer for twenty years he shows it to me one day tells me hes got a star interested would i produce it
two time academy award nominee martin weir
one of his best parts
she looks familiar
anyway murray has this shrink who also happens to be martins personal trainers shrink murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to martins trainer who reads it to martin while they work out and martin flips loves it
the problem is murray he and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the kern a few weeks ago murray never made it back
doris murrays widow finds out about this martin weir thing and says since murray and i never had any written contract she wants five hundred grand for the script
that or im thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow saffrin 
just a thought
you dont even know these guys
what do you get out of this
lovejoy sits behind the wheel watching the bar across the street getting his video camera ready for action  whats he doing following a guy
no leave em up we want the light in their eyes ill be at the desk but dont introduce me let it go just start talking youre gonna be here behind em when they sit down
you dont say any moren you have to you say well im glad you assholes stopped by so i can set you straight
what
i had to tell em something
you tell me you want these guys off your back next thing i know youre saying yeah maybe they can have a piece of mr lovejoy i couldnt believe my fuckin ears
thats the difference between you and me harry i say what i mean i want something from someone i ask em straight out i want martin weir i go get martin weir i dont fuck around with his trainers shrink
hows anyone gonna see anything from way up there
heres your keys harry
is he giving you a check or cash
okay harry im wrong youre not the one hes setting up
really
so how bout it mr selznick do i make my deal with bo or you gonna finally help me out have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him
forget about leos money harry
harry if i gave you leos money youd have ray bones all over your ass and then youd be in a whole new kinda trouble
ray barboni guy from miami owns leo now that momo died
maybe i oughta talk to this ray bones character myself see if he wants to invest in my movie
you cut straight hair in this place or just fags
you got a miss leo devoe guys six weeks over
yeah he told me
yeah ray he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines jet went down last month
it was in the herald
which also means when i speak im speakin for jimmy so eg as of now you start affording me the proper respect
bullshit eg is short for ergo
you owe me the dry cleaners fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another uhh
yeah that was a good party
well you had it down cold watching you in the movie if i didnt know better id have to believe you were a made guy and not acting even the fink part i never met a fink and i hope to god i never do but how you did it must be the way finks act
we talk different
you mean like we dont give a shit
so you dont know what im thinking
so you want to know
im thinking of a movie
one were producing
martin im not connected to those people anymore not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off i go after him the fuck you think i do
no i want you to look at me the way im looking at you put it in your eyes youre mine asshole without saying it
what youre telling me youre tired you wanna go to bed
how about this
thats what i think of you asshole nothing
i turn it on when i confront the guy
the wife sues the airline  this is a gutsy babe
so when do i meet up with the husband and give him the look
at that point basically that has to be it
lemme talk to buddy set up a meeting
very nice
whats that
whatta you think chill
i wouldnt think youre that dumb leave over three hundred grand in the closet underneath the extra blanket but i guess you are
youre here a while whats wrong with a bank
youve been losing
from when you left vegas with four fifty
now youre down to threeten in the case you mustve cooled off quite a bit since you got here
it was fay wasnt it told you about the money she tell you my whole life history for christs sake
how by taking my money
its all mine
you take all my money but youre borrowing part of it
but you wont know where i am i dont even know where ill be
its not one of these
we call you a taxi
mr barboni is a good customer  works for jimmy capp
the door from the patio in back
no it was open it wasnt locked
well basically this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand plus hes a few weeks behind on the vig the interest you have to pay
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand
but a week thats a hundred and fifty percent a year
a couple days ago by people from the airliner come to see his wife tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement the amount based on what he wouldve earned operating the dry cleaners the rest of his life leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys so they were giving him about ten years
hey karen how ya doin
i wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like i did last night
no no you left the patio door open you gotta stop doin that all the nice things you got around here
rough day on the set
ripped nylons work makes the shot more real
you saw that one
yeah that was a good scene i mean for a horror movie
i know im better than what ive been doing the last ten years walking around in a tank top and fuckme pumps waiting till its time to scream
yeah its a real gift  im just saying itd be nice one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line you know like in that bette davis picture cabin in the
how come you stopped making movies with harry
you read harrys new one he says its the best thing hes ever read
that why harry came over last night see if you could help him get martin in his movie
harry told me martin loves it he flipped
tell you what ill stop by harrys office and pick up a copy for you
well i gotta have a talk with leo my runaway dry cleaner
you been here the whole time
i got you a copy of the script
i think its not horrible
then youve read it
you and harryll make a great team  im gonna make a deal with him
i dont want to act in it i want to produce it with harry especially if i help him get martin
that why you came over here to ask me that
why does anyone want to be in movies
i was never much into it all that bullshit having to do with respect its bad enough having to treat those guys like theyre your heroes having to smile when they make some stupid remark they thinks real funny
this things actually accurate i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset
well actually martin the movie we came to talk about is mr lovejoy
a locker at the airport jesus christ harry tell me youre not really that stupid
that was martin he wants to have lunch tomorrow that is if you can make it
howd you meet martin anyway
i dont know im just havin some trouble seeing you two together
oh i like him i just think hes short i mean hes a good actor and all but im wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty
so what about your story you thought of a title yet
how bout chilis hollywood adventure
yeah
i think you could be an actor i know youre acting sometimes but you dont show it
no i dont mean that i just meant in general
you dont mean a movie star more like a character actor
i mean i could see myself in movies robert de niro had been in or i could maybe do an al pacino movie play a hardon but i couldnt see myself in ones like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby they dont know how to take care of it and you see these big grownup assholes acting cute 
harry my god
what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway
why not
harry whatre you doing youre supposed to be in the hospital
you sure
its not dave its a movie
i dont know
you okay
karen what the fuck are you doing
were you scared up there
you dont act like it
ill be right back
what took you so long
theyre closing the granview you know theater down on biscayne
momo could buy it i could run it for him show some cagney films
you sure it was ray bones took the coat
hey chili  get your coat but dont piss the guy off okay it could get complicated and wed have to call momo to straighten it out then momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we dont need that
no i said im never goin to bed theres a difference see the article says most people die in their beds i figure long as i stay outta bed im safe
i told you not to 
i hate to say i told you but i did i told you dont start nothing with him that time
no you just broke his fuckin nose instead
all i know is he came by the barber shop all fuckin undone wanting to know where you were staying in vegas i told him i dont know i still dont
he already knew it
whatta you doing out there
whatre you talking about you wanna be a movie star
how you gonna do that you dont know shit about making movies
yeah but whose point of view
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene
yeah what three words harry
hm
so mildred says to the cashier i saw the new streisand picture  god i just love it at the end when she brushed robert redfords hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other but knew they couldnt be together that look was so romantic
hello doris
well arent you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like
what a spectacular view
i miss murray harry
im not sure how i feel about this doris
i mean morally murray was my friend
so this means youve reconsidered our deal on mr lovejoy
yeah whatd he have to say
whats wrong
when i came upstairs you stayed to finish your drink i told you to turn off the tv when you were through  come to think of it i also told you you could sleep in the maids room
i dont have a dog
anyone skim the pool it needs it
how did you get in the house
that miami flight that went down it was on the news every day for about a week harry mustve been busy
with your experience you could always become an agent right harry
well i got an audition tomorrow
what im saying harry is i want you and your new buddy to get out of my house
harry whatre you still doing with those guys
harry we spoke with martin
harry 
which two
i have to run but what i hope to see they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money it becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it but in the end they cant can they
the three hundred large what other money is there  i should keep quiet i know till ive read the script but ive got a feeling about this one im that shylock
karen wow look at you
im sitting here im looking at you and im having these flashes you know flashbacks of memories  of us
yeah and im wondering how did it go wrong how did it all slip away
oh for christs sake 
lufkin his agent
but you are interested
hi sweetface you look great and mmmmm you smell good too
i have to consider i mean as the mob guy this is another mans wife im sleeping with
arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior this is united states coastguard station north island over
affirmative arctic warrior what type of vessel
a passenger liner north island over
passenger vessel chimera i will spell charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha no registry information is available at this time i have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west five seven north at  two zero one four hours zulu time over
north island please repeat over
north island have you got any additional information over
roger north island i am tied to the passenger vessel chimera and she is afloat repeat she is afloat over
roger north island please advise pending further information over
arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior this is united states coastguard station north island your radio check is affirmative over
hear that dodge epps dont think its a problem
looks like epps gonna get some tonight
hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back
you think the extra strain caused it
how about now
what you sure
are you crazy do you realize we got ourselves a ship we own a ship dodge
fucker
damn mind of its own
one minute im minding my own business the next thing i know the whole place is burning up  an oxygen tank mustve blown on the welder started an oil fire
whats so great about sweden
yeah but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about
wheres his boat then wheres his crew he aint gonna be out here by himself thats for damn sure
lets not be too hasty
i need lag bolts especially one inch standard and sheet metal preferably steel about a sixteenth of an inch aluminium even tinll do
what day is it
when they find out what its carrying they may not be so interested in whats legal
the turbine blew
youd think on a ship this size thered be something left to eat
where from
one more
what is your first name
maureen
maureen
roger
you think thats funny
probably slipped her moorings got tangled up in a current
seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it aint gonna be what youd call easy  any questions
ready
nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot
last thing we want is extra partners
thiss gonna hurt a little
what other choices have we got
guess ill just keep working
light in those passages aint so good
maybe that is his boat
fifty million dollars fifty million we gonna let this guy just take it from us one guy
one guy isnt gonna be so stupid
pretty handy with that scatter gun epps you raised on a farm
smokes
im no doctor but id say hes in a coma
i dont know what else youd call it hes breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out hes totally unresponsive to pain  what happened up there
other than the obvious theres nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside
try wednesday
did you
what say epps you up for some roasted albatross
dodge  dodge
get up
you arent jealous are you dodge
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here its way out of the lanes theres not a port for 800 miles
yeah from one side of the harbor to the other but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over
if you get it back in one piece
its a bloody navigation hazard one boat cant control a ship that size
with a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make sitka in five days without another stop
mother fucker
the number one turbines pretty well trashed number two runs but its way underpowered
whats this
i thought you said it was just a blade
how much longers that gonna take
i know i know two ways to do anything 
but how long
we gotta get outa here dodge a storm blows up and were history
what about running number two by itself
how long then
how long
goddamit dodge
obviously its some kind of screw up the shipping records arent a hundred percent accurate
went aboard
its a hell of a lot of money
didnt happen yesterday ill tell you that torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat
or somebody stopped them
so whatre we gonna do thats the big question right
then were rich were damn filthy stinking rich
you gotta be kidding what the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks
yeah yeah im on it
im buyin me a nice outrigger spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget
dreamins all any of youre gonna be doing if we dont get this boat running
sounds like the hull
if somebodys aboard her already she aint ours shes theirs
i say fuck the motherfucker were a professional salvage crew going about our business whats some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway
what if that fucker finds it before were ready to go
if hes reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal if not well have to reconsider our options
bodiesre too fresh
damn barbaric is what it is
thatd be my guess
cant you use something else
do what you need to do just do it fast
dodge to murphy
you better get down here quick skipper im on c deck cabin 400
it was a mans voice repeating some sort of childrens rhyme i dont know it didnt make any sense you didnt hear it
on a passenger ship in 1953
so i got a question just from a you know purely technical standpoint we call the coastguard  coastguard shows up what exactly is the plan
well theyre gonna be asking a lot of questions about us about those bodies about the gold seems like we oughta be prepared is all
yeah well the truth is one thing when theres more than a few hundred million dollars involved thats a whole new deal
theres no way were gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here besides itll be safer where it is
just what the hell do you think youre doing
i think you know
the radio
take it easy willya what about the radio
what
what the fuck  
i didnt touch the fucking radio  ever occur to you theres somebody else on that boat skipper
yeah
what the hell happened
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants
i dont figure theres much i want money cant buy
well stand the watch on deck tonight youre up first
tomorrow well see if we cant find some line and tackle use some of those bodies below decks for bait
youre late
dont fall asleep
whats slow
morning everybody
showed him a hell of a lot more than that
could be a fishing boat
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass
you mean before she sank
then why didnt they take it
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold
thats a good thing
whatd he look like
coffee
stay away or else
any dizziness
headache nausea lights
sudden flashes of light
i dont even want to know what thats gonna taste like now
you okay
what
i cant believe you dodges dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share
candy
go on
the laws on our side if they want to challenge it let them try
coffee
whatd you find up there
she was sailing up north right
ever heard of the mary celeste
she was a twomasted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872  one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel the dei gratia as the crew of the dei gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste on boarding they found her completely deserted the captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble the table was even set for dinner and in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard
nobody knows thereve been a lot of theories of course but well never really know for sure
i think wed be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current
maybe they didnt want it back maybe the whole fat deal was insured
why not call for help
take it easy youll live longer
who
what guy
what what the hellre you talking about
are you sure
you sure it wasnt me
so we find this guy and make a deal with him
guess thatd be me again
no cowboy shit up there understand
got your light
murphy to epps
you just shoot at something
just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio
he needs a doctor
hows he doing
theyre dead in the water that morning four hours later the captains relieved of his command and that evening they issue a general sos
youre saying they mutinied for the gold
the ah the radios out
smashed it up pretty bad
the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill
the same day she supposedly went down
their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision distress calls have been made
the pages missing then their sos was real
maybe the other ship took the worst of it
its a good bet theyll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too
its not gonna hold us
hey
couldnt sleep
what do you think happened on this boat
the what
are we smart enough to avoid that
when you found me yesterday at the pool id seen something  someone
what like some kind of ghost
maybe hallucination is the wrong word it was more than that as though they were showing me
what happened
no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims
something bad happened here murphy
she said the ship was evil that we had to leave right away that if we didnt we might never leave
why you how come the rest of us havent seen these people
murphy to epps
nope
epps you there
what do we do with him
what do you think
over the gold
they went crazy
hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water
what happened
what
you killed them
so you killed them
and now youre gonna kill me is that it
murphy dont you see whats happening
its the ship the ships making you think this way
its a trap there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold nobody ever does its just the bait this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out
i dont give a damn about the gold
greer to murphy
the number nine on the starboard sides half flooded epps says its a slow leak just under the waterline about twenty gallons an hour they mustve pumped it before we left sitka
let the buyer beware
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia
i must be in the wrong business
red sky at night sailors delight
yeah
i been watching it for close to an hour and it hasnt moved i cant raise it on the radio either makes me think it might be in trouble
too deep to anchor out there
call the coastguard
its funny
murphy goddamit
whatever the reason shes adrift and abandoned weve got every right to salvage her
all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it
some classy tub in its day huh
morning
how much you figure thats worth skipper
if they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off
so what we gonna unload the gold and get a move on
yeah but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka
i heard that
what now
fifty million four ways thats twelve million and change a piece  what you gonna do with your share skipper
greer
i dont know
i say we offload some of that gold now
pretty low all around
holy shit
greek citizen merchant navy  obviously we arent the first to come across this ship they probably stumbled across it just like we did
maybe eppss mystery man had something to do with it
never been more thirsty in my life
howre you feeling
what happened
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera down somewhere in there scavenging around
say what
oh man
were not gonna be able to pump it
we aint exactly in what youd call your high traffic neighborhood either
gettin a little hot under the collar id say
its a noaa buoy
were still drifting
he took the shotgun and a light
cant find the shotgun
what about the gold
now hold up just a minute lets be reasonable here
nobodys going anywhere with that gold now anybody tries to board well know about it  you can do what you want greer but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that
what seems to be the trouble ladies
as i said what seems to be the trouble
these ladies was having themselves a discussion and youre interrupting it
i thought you say tuesday

enid and i were just friends you know we feel comfortable around each other she really likes my old records and
and what can you tell us about this 
who is this enid
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject
these are all valid comments but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this
did you actually do this painting
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism
and how does an image like this help us to see that
enid can i talk to you for a minute
dont worry  its nothing bad i was just wondering what your plans were for next year

ive been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that were like these totally rich yuppies

how much is it
yeah it took a while before i got a chance to play it but when i heard that song it was like

wow this is so cool
what the fuck seymour what is this

for nineteen years
nothing so glamorous actually im an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters
hey i get good benefits a good early retirement plan nobody ever bothers me
so i dont really get it  are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this

i know its not like it makes all your problems go away
actually ive got a total crush on this one guy right now but its a really fuckedup situation
oh wait you met him remember that guy josh im like practically obsessed with him but i cant do anything about it because becky would freak out
never mind its way too complicated  did you have problems like this when you were my age  where youre totally confused all the time
i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them
arent you going to get that
wow  what was that all about
that didnt sound like a joke to me what did you write a personal ad or something
seymour i promise you that wasnt a joke  you have to call her back
uh hello

where did you get this
god shes going to kill me this bottle is halfempty
if you expect the worst youre never disappointed
im just being realistic
i hate sports
youre a beautiful young girl i cant imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity
i mean of course i why wouldnt i want to go out with you
yeah sure of course
what about joe
you know what my number one fantasy used to be
i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place do you ever think about stuff like that
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it and id just disappear and theyd never see me again
you know what we should do lets go get in your car right now and just take off we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life fuck everybody
ill drive then  well go out in a blaze of glory
who cares lets just go whats stopping us
im serious im just so sick of everybody why cant i just do whatever i want
what do you want
god danas going to kill you
what maybe no i dunno
no forget it
yeah well me neither
i was just thinking out loud  i mean youve got this whole thing with dana  im not going to let you fuck that up
i really want to talk to you ive been thinking about what you said about moving in here
so whats the story with the two cheerleaders over here
seymour you gotta be kidding me
let me tell ya somethin joe listen to me joe you cant hit a home run without swinging the bat
well heres where the fun never stops
where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records  she could at least have the decency to call me back
maybe shes got another boyfriend
please josh
so josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us
i agree
did you remember to pay the phone bill
i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there aremany different ways we can express ourselves  we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class  who is responsible for this
talk to us about it
what do we have here margaret
i can see that now what can you tell us about it first of all what kind of sculpture is this
very good now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent
this shocking image of repressed femininity
uh hi uh enids stepmother told me id find her here
no they said she was here
uh do you mind if i wait i really need to talk to her
why would she be hiding from me
maybe shes with josh
i dont know
she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating  i thought maybe she was
i have no idea  i just want to
really i dont know enough about it to
why did you say she might be hiding from me did she say anything to you about me
did she say that
what do you mean
what are you talking about
i have to admit things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit
well mostly archival research cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues its really i cant believe it
it doesnt pay very much but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months do you think thats too soon im really anxious to get my record collection out of storage
thank you doctor
seymour
you were contracted to work
let me see the sick
there is no reason for fear
oh sing a different song abdullah  theres nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is
he sees this chaos hell replace you all
morning friend glorious day
the next time will be as this time the devil has come to tsavo
i wasnt and you know it and dont push it just listen we have a problem in tsavo
no hints samuel
i am a man of peace
most certainly absolutely yes
starting now we attack them
john henry patterson come in im robert beaumont  firm i like that tells me a lot about you  now why dont you tell me about me to get you started many people find me handsome with a wonderful smile im sure you agree  winning personality heaps of charm
build the bridge over the tsavo river and be finished in four months time can you do that
youve never built in africa
youll need your confidence i promise you
very moving patterson im touched you confided in me  but i dont really give a shit about your upcoming litter ive made you with this assignment  dont make me break you
pleasant journey
lovely sound they seem happy
truthfully  there has been the occasional odd hiccup but then as you so wisely told me id never built in africa
i do need to see starling
awhile back he ordered some bibles  ive brought them  is he here
its what the natives are calling the lions  two lions have been causing trouble
it hasnt been that simple so far
this is supposed to be salvation  what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here
in that half will be bait human bait ill start things off  a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor
are you running a high fever man how could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed how could you even conceive of it
and it worked
what
let me explain about time youve been here three months and already two months behind and the germans and the french are gearing up and i dont care about you and i dont care about the thirty dead i care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule ill get my knighthood and i want it  professional hunters may be the answer
im going to try and locate redbeard i assume youve heard of him
understand i had help
this sham ridiculous who needs it its only being built to control the ivory trade make men richer
i know its your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey  but what are you going to do about it
youre certain about tomorrow  but you dont seem excited 
im david hawthorne this is my hospital and my advice to you is dont get sick in front of it  that was meant to be charming sorry i seem to have lost the knack
a maneater attacks and youre such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it
then he feasted on him starting with his feet
thats a terrible idea
silliest thing i ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that
i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived
i tried to be late john it would have been easier if youd gone
tell me about beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are how lucky he is to have you
oh dear  youre geting that downtrodden look again
oh please if id been against your taking this you would have abandoned me youve been desperate to see africa your whole life
go now  such a gentleman 
very good indeed
all right youll spend your nights inside  youll have plenty of ammunition youre totally protected you have really nothing to fear
not once you didnt hit it once
well of course he kept moving but he couldnt have been more than ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing
many thanks  youre patterson yes  nigel starling ill be assisting you at tsavo but surely beaumont must have told you that
dont much like them
anything special about them
ive lived in africa a year and i dont know what you know how long have you been here
every time i see something like that i know were right to be here to bring christianity into their lives enrich their souls
we all have our reasons mine is simply to make them understand happiness accept salvation know the serenity that comes  best i stop one of the byproducts of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring but i know god smiles on me
samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts
excellent could i see the bridge site 
finish your tour
i couldnt believe it when you said sort it out as if it were the most normal thing in the world hohum what lovely tea i think ill bag a killer beast this evening nothing much else going on anyway
you said of course youd need the donkey why of course
i dont suppose i could watch
ive never been all that adventurous i wouldnt be in the way
i hate to be a bother john but the cramps getting worse  the pain is actually quite unbearable now
im sure you mean that to be comforting but
john i know this isnt the time to ask but
since youd only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions
one shot
with much more on the way  john we could have had this chat on flatter ground
how lucky we are
all right thee second embankment will go there 
in your honor nigel and you and singh will be in charge of building them and youll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and youll be finished in eight thrilling weeks
ill try but this feels so different that old lion i killed could never carry off a man singhs size
second death where
what a good week
i didnt have a chance to thank you
got me out of trouble
we need to talk
actually no
i dont really but understand something even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out  when im gone youll still have to build the bridge and i dont want the men to have lost respect for you
have you got it
the best way to ensure the kill when youre using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter have you ever led trackers
samuel says you killed a lion
misfire it jammed
think about something else
goddammit
meant to ask you the railroad car trap your idea  excellent notion i used the same device myself once
it would have been a beautiful bridge john i never noticed before occupied with other business isuppose  never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but ive had the time today nothing else on and this its graceful and the placement couldnt be prettier and 
in my town when i was little there was a brute a bully who terrorized the place  but he was not the problem he had a brother who was worse than he but the brother was not the problem  one or the other of them was usually in jail the problem came when they were both free togther the two became different from either alone  alone they were only brutes together they became lethal together they killed
their den  have you ever seen anything like this
where could it have gone how could it get across the water  theyre only lions yes
theyre used to people in trees not in a clearing  it may be tight
ill be bait alone
ill have to
its certainly the best chance theyve had to kill you
good luck
how many do you think theyve killed
i never thought id say this but im glad you came
why do the workers look unhappy
its all wonderfully under control samuel youve done a splendid job
the workers dont get on
did it look like this in your mind
i am also liaison between these two
what are they looking at
nonsense
we should construct thorn fences around every tent area fires burning at night
oh yes i think so 
for you
good news
do you love her
soon 
you like him dont you
youve known him long
thank you  why does he need you by him
three years ive worked for the railroad now i dont know why it seemed a good idea once
he has children
where is it
afraid of lions
why do you laugh you dont believe she taught me
how many cattle
why so many
did you ever see a lion that size
gentlemen theres no sickness smell at all here and little blood when we leave close the gate securely dont open it til morning and keep your fires high any questions ask them now  you two will sleep beautifully in your tents  and stay there
where do you go next
my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder our lives have crossed because two lions went mad but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity was that worth all the lives too soon to tell
oh yes i got in a little late this morning janosz
well be very sorry to lose you  perhaps i could take you to lunch today
every day i ask you and every day youve got something else to do  do i have bad breath or something
janosz
do you need anything  you want me to come in
okay just thought id check  good night dana  sleep well  dont let the bedbugs bite you
dana arent you going to introduce me to your friend
what do you want with my baby
if this is what the world will be like i dont want to live in it
everybody has a choice
time is running out dana  soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine  and vigos  well mainly vigos  but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship
i know  marry me dana and together we will raise vigo as our son  there are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god  im sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment  and perhaps a car and free parking
many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other  think about it
hundreds of people  believe me i didnt imagine this
what are you working on egon
well do the happiness index next  id like to bring ray in on your case if its all right with you
oh no
occasionally
venkman  i think he was borderline for a while there  then he crossed the border
this is my address and telephone number will you call me

im sure you didnt come here just to talk about art
he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman i hate this painting  ive felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage
i may be wrong but i think youve got a little crush on this guy
im sorry  were you on your way out
you know if anyone else told me that id have serious doubts  but coming from you i cant honestly say im surprised
who could blame him  were you wearing this nightgown
this is joe namaths old number you know you could get a lot of chicks with this just dont pee in it
well take care of that  ray pete  listen get over to danas right away  her bathtub pulled a fast one  tried to eat the kid
bathrooms right here  let me just tidy up a few things
be careful on that sofa  its a buttbiter but the beds good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired feel free  in fact i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here
for me its best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me  if we go the other way im afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night
or we could do that
are you all squeaky clean now
they didnt find anything  in the bathtub  the pink ooze  nothing  so what do i do now
im not here to date  i cant leave oscar in a strange place with someone i dont know

thats a terrible thing to say
hi ray  its good to see you  thanks for coming

sorry
according to my sources the world will end on february 14 in the year 2016
i received this information from an alien  i was at the paramus holiday inn i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking  then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and thats where he told me about the end of the world
it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn  i cant be sure peter

hi welcome back to the world of the psychic im peter venkman and im chatting with my guest author lecturer and of course psychic milton anglund  milt your new book is called the end of the world  isnt that kind of like writing about gum disease  yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it
okay so can you tell us when its going to happen or do we have to buy the book
this year  thats cutting it a little close isnt it  i mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right  so youre not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year  and its going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movieoftheweek or miniseries potential you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even 94 just to be safe
yes i did  we were city champs
so dr venkman please explain to the court why it is you and your codefendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street
ill ask you again dr venkman  why were you digging the hole  and please remember that youre under oath
so what are you saying  that the world of the supernatural is your special province
egon
howve you been  hows teaching  i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours huh
id like to have a stool specimen

oh sure  im getting used to this
hello  im peter venkman  may i help you
were all professionals here miss 
 and then i opened the door again but it was gone  there was nothing there
why would anyone make up a thing like that
is that your professional opinion
no just that one word  zuul  but i have no idea what it means
have you ever thought of moving out  at least until this disturbance blows over
you play the cello  its my favorite instrument
id have to say prokofievs third concerto
you really dont act like a scientist
like a used car salesman
thats too bad
uhhuh
youre quite a housekeeper
damn
theres nothing there now and i dont get any significant readings
if its any comfort to you i dont think youre crazy
im a qualified psychologist  ive got a degree and everything  i believe that something happened here and i want to do something about it
i think i should spend the night here
on a purely scientific basis
i want to help you
dont scream
okay okay  but if anything else happens you have to promise youll call me
okay  then ill go
great rehearsal
youre the best one in your row
i dont have to take abuse from you  i have other people dying to give it to me
whos the stiff
he is a very close friend  do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment
cant you tell me now
you must have gotten the last copy
hittites  the mesopotamians and the sumerians  zuul was the minion of gozer
whats he doing in my refrigerator
i dont think so  im busy thursday night
all right  since you put it that way
hey dana  what is it  what happened
we must prepare for the coming of gozer
he is the destructor
do you want this body
actually its more of a policy than a rule
i dont know  youve got two people in there already  it could get a little crowded  i want you to close your eyes and relax  now im going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer
right  youre the gatekeeper  but i want dana  dana speak to me 
nothing  we just got rid of that thing in your kitchen
yeah along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions  this one took some work
this is going to cost you you know  our fees are ridiculously high
i trust youre moving us to a better space somewhere on campus
this is preposterous  i demand an explanation
but why  the students love us
that is one speedy mutt
well that definitely looks like marshmallow to me
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street
hello im roger delacorte  the head librarian  are you the men from the university
thank you for coming  id appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly
whats that got to do with it
did you see it  what was it
youre very handy i can tell  i bet you like to read a lot too
thats very fascinating to me  i read a lot myself  some people think im too intellectual  but i think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time  i also play racketball  do you ever play
its a great game  you should play sometime  i bet youd be good  you seem very athletic  do you have any hobbies
oh thats very  unusual
egon theres something very strange about that man  im very psychic usually and right now i have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you  im afraid youre going to die
in the physical sense
i want you to have this 
its a souvenir from the 1964 worlds fair at flushing meadow  its my lucky coin
keep it anyway  i have another one at home
why dont you step into the office and well talk about it  hold all my calls janine
heres the paper on the brooklyn job  she paid with a visa card
and someone from the epa is here to see you
i didnt ask him  all i know is that i havent had a break in two weeks and you promised youd hire more help
thank you for coming so quickly  the guests are starting to ask questions and im running out of excuses
well most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor  the disturbances i mean  but its been quiet for years  up until two weeks ago  it was never ever this bad though
heavens no  the owners dont like us to even talk about it  i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight
can i help you
great  hows it going
exactly what are you a doctor of mr venkman
i see  and now you catch ghosts
and how many ghosts have you caught mr venkman
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them
and would this storage facility be located on these premises
and may i see this storage facility
and why not mr venkman
and what is the magic word mr venkman
may i please see the storage facility
well because im curious  i want to know more about what you do here  frankly there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation for instance the storage of noxious possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement  now either you show me whats down there or i come back with a court order
have it your way mr venkman
at ease officers  im peter venkman  i think theres been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can
you turned off the power  look there was another man here  you have to find him and bring him back  a short determinedlooking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie
the man is a psychopath your honor
mr mayor its a pretty simple choice you can believe mr pecker here 
all right  what is it
circle
nervous
well just 75 more to go  whats this one
hey  im getting a little tired of this
yeah but i didnt know you were going to give me electric shocks  what are you trying to prove
ill tell you the effect  it pisses me off
hey mister  can i see those guns
yeah yeah  i just want to see em
wait  wait  let me ask you something  if you like shot superman with those guns would he feel it or what
yes
what on earth gave you that idea
youre a regular sherlock holmes  now what do you want
oh  youre here
oh this is big peter  this is very big theres definitely something here
spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost
just for your information ray the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over 75000
generally you dont see that kind of behavior in a major appliance  what do you think egon
did you see anything
something was definitely here
wait  wait  theres something i forgot to tell you
dont cross the beams
trust me  it will be bad
its peter egon  ive got a problem
im with dana barrett and shes floating three feet off the bed
i dont think so  its more of that gozer thing  she says shes the gatekeeper  does that make any sense to you
yeah yeah  i was just thinking  it probably wouldnt be a good idea for them to get together at this point
all right  ill try
he wants to shut down the storage grid
wheres the keymaster
of course  ivo shandor  i saw his name in tobins spirit guide  he started a secret society in 1920
yes  after the first world war shandor decided that society was too sick to survive  and he wasnt alone  he had close to a thousand followers when he died  they conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world
who
you talked to gozer
what now
on the count of three  one  two 
no  you said crossing the beams would be bad  itll kill her  and us
you know peter this could be a past life experience intruding on the present
i just realized something  weve never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment
sorry buddy
ray  where are you  are you all right
its working
set entry grid
ive got to sleep
what happened
look at the structure of the roof cap  it looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies
you mean if i stand here and concentrate on the image of roberto clemente gozer will appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out
excuse me for a minute  ray im right in the middle of something here  can you come back in about an hour
sure  thats great ray  i think you should get down there right away and check it out  let me know what happens
spengler and i have charted every psychic occurrence in the tristate area for the past two years  the graph we came up with definitely points to something big
what do you mean by seen
well i was at an unexplained multiple highaltitude rockfall once
what is it
i told you its real
i dont know  talk to it
anything  just make contact
get her  that was your whole plan  you call that science
if you guys are right if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow i think i could win the nobel prize
you said you floored em at the regents meeting
this is like a major disgrace  forget mit or stanford now  they wouldnt touch us with a threemeter cattle prod
do you know what a patent clerk makes  i liked the university  they gave us money they gave us the facilities and we didnt have to produce anything  ive worked in the private sector  they expect results youve never been out of college  you dont know what its like out there
for what purpose
youll never regret this ray
youre not going to lose the house everybody has three mortgages these days
but most people are afraid to even report these things
wow  does this pole still work
everybody can relax  i found the car  how do you like it
why dont i check out the building  it may have a history of psychic turbulence
how was your date
they will
so do i
im getting high readings near the air vents  it must be using the duct system to get around  see i told you wed get something
ray  somethings here
third floor  get down here
its here ray  its looking at me
how do you know
boy that was a rough one
egon hows the grid around the storage facility holding up
i guess they dont build them like they used to huh
who was the architect
it doesnt seem to have slowed him down any
as a dulyconstituted representative of the city of new york and on behalf of the county and state of new york the united states of america the planet earth and all its inhabitants i hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension
agile bastard isnt he
i couldnt help it  it just popped in there
and you came up with that
very impressive resume  electronic countermeasures strategic air command  black belt in karate  small arms expert  mr zeddemore as you may have heard we locate ghosts and spirits trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from peoples homes offices and places of worship
hey man  what is it youre so involved with there
are you a christian ray
me too
do you believe in god
me too parts of the bible are great
ray do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves
right  and the sky would fall 
yeah judgement day
you dont have to worry about that with us sir
stantz  you okay in there
whats he talking about  choose what
where are we now commodus  can you see the camp  my gods  the air is turning into ice
thats what you told me two days ago
more wine sister  surely you can drink more than that
quite so  narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve rome
dont you think you should at least wave
they hate me they really hate me dont they
i should at least have you dont you think
did narcissus die today  wasnt this his day to die
no one in rome has ever heard of him  do you want to remind those few in the senate who have  the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with  forget about him
those are priceless sculptures
its disgusting  animals  i had to come here under armed guard  slaves  get this junk out of my sight
how about in the forum  right in front of the senate
for the gods spit it out
kill him  tribuus  execute that bastard
tribuus tomorrow
where have you been
you must start clearing everything with me  especially your lovers
what is that wailing
now that is a happy sound tomorrow i want the citizens  my people  back in the arena  the gods know im tired  come to bed now tonight were celebrating
now that were done with that infatuation forever
 encased in the armor of a demigod narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast
tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger
i want that bastard dead
i am their hero
lykas pick a man  someone who will look good  jerses i want it built up in the daily action
damn him  i should have killed him on the front  i let you talk me out of that
welcome back from your great triumph narcissus meridas  my father sends his heart felt praise  sadly marcus is in dark humors  nothing to worry about but he needs rest likely just the weather
do you expect marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience
then youd be out of a job
i back rome against all her enemies  if that answer disappoints you im not a politician
i would say theres nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what right is
but theyre not destroyed not yet
you and my father have become very close  perhaps one day i may say the same for us
being as close im certain youve noticed what we all have noticed
im ordering a general standdown in preparation for withdrawal back across the danube
forgive me caesar but do two senator represent the mood of the whole senate or the will of the roman people  besides every truce we make with the germans they break
where is my family
the army is a problem  they love you  you have led them from victory to victory in the name of rome and they love you  and after all youre just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty  who could fault you for that  thus have i reached a compromise with the senate over your fate instead of executing you im sending you to rome where you will be tried
endorse me in public  do that and ill make you rich and set you free ill return your estates  i know you would give anything to be outside again  endorse me and you will be free  think of it  what would you do with your freedom
insubordination  to the emperor and the senate
the senate is out to sink you  i swear it caesar your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor  your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of janus when you must be confirmed the senate will be able to deny you
caesar ignore them
gods of hell  this must cost a fortune  how many days is this going to go on
and like children everywhere they scream freedom the most when they desire it least  i beg you please continue caesar
throw it down into the streets down into the forum  if its my father they want then give him to them
maybe itll crush gaius
so am i
give away food
take grain away from the army
caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena
gladly caesar  and if youd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light
marcus aurelius has died
we must obey our emperor and the senate
this is the only place in rome where i thought  i believed  i was wholly in power
its because he comes off as the underdog
where is my father
tribuus what happened in the arena was narcissus killed
why isnt he dead  damn you you promised me he would be dead
yes caesar
tribuus  go left here i want to see my new statue at via claudia
you won an impossible fight  you got the attention of the crowd legate
caesar commodus discovering his lineage converges with the demigod hercules has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens  the emperors going to fight in the arena  im supposed to write this for tomorrows edition
cos what in hades is the emperor up to  and dont tell me you dont know
agh  please  hes having a secret device constructed for the circus the brass craftsmen are working overtime
so tell me what happened between you and the emperor  what really happened on the german front  you know the senates arguing your case
my birth sign is water bearer twentyfifth day in the month of janus
the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates  he was born on august thirtyfirst you know
its time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border  its time to tell the citizens everything  will you write it
the battle was won today and i prefer to believe it was a gift of janus the eldest god of rome  god of my ancestors
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory  thanks to marcus aurelius
ive read of it
i would venture with all respect the emperors health is the business of every soul in the empire
a republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes  at the core hes a man who believes in doing whats right
the senate too
who are you  narcissus the good  i have heard of narcissus meridas thats who i hear you are
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial  youd have to give me your word
youre a citizen and a soldier  not a gladiator
you on your way to trial too general  or do you think theyve already had our trial
my loyalties were in doubt
is this rome  are we just going to be executed
no futuretelling please ive been terrified enough for one day
you know our two most senior senators  gaius cantus and falco verus
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities
without him  hed be weeping if he overheard that  well  the idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting
why do you keep playing at being so humble  its a little embarrassing
how do you know i am playing  well the clown is always harmless  isnt that right  and how did you ever get to know me so well  the last we spent any time together i was fourteen  i think you know me better than my father  hes going to die isnt he
its my brothers neck you want not mine
i came here to see that you stay alive  the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus a hero
twenty years ive led men to die for me it was the glory of rome but that was something  if it wasnt that then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore  but that was something  these men here are butchered for laughs  their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line
to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman  read to sleep on catullus lucretius virgil every night  my beautiful daughters
if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads but
you cannot die
marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
where are they
commodus its we who are going on the offensive
i want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign
ive made so many mistakes narcissus  we all put off the very last duties of our lives because were afraid of admitting when our lives are over
servis made it through again
if id ever had a sign that you wanted to rule i would have no again its my own bullheadedness narcissus i should have adopted you years ago  and now the gods are begging me to make you my son
its not because hes young its because hes ignorant and arrogant his sister is a better man  thats why i have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the senate
everyone talking about it  i wouldnt wonder  all i seek is a genuine balance of power between the emperor and the senate  thus i have transferred legal power  which was theirs to begin with  back to the senators  this includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan  its a start only a start  if the emperor and the senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share  this means commodus has to bend does he strike you as that type
a man should be upright not be kept upright  history shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities  even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute  i want you to consider becoming my heir
the senators admire you
they fear change  the new caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible  you could be the one the emperor the man who oversees the rebirth of the republic
i made the plume from a quail feather
dont stop to visit  take the children straight home and ill follow as soon as i can
as soon as i can
i see the emperors little boy has finally caught up with the army
what the hell was all that about
why dont we try to keep politics out of the conversation
serious stuff
everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal
rome is going to pay tribute  like a defeated nation begging for mercy have you told your troops that
on his death bed i promised marcus i would complete our work here  the senate may be vacillating but i have the army behind me  im taking half a cohort and restocking that fort
you brought the army into rome
its your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons
quintus youve got at least a division with you  we could take rome away from commodus and give it back to the senate
then give the empire back to the people the children who will grow up to become senators
what are you fighting for in here the good of rome  i can end this madness now  take the job for the sake of the gods live
hes very realistic
well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers
what about their philosophy lessons
you need to come home
the battle is over  the war is over  youve won
this is our oil from our estates
very fancy  did you design the bottle
im a soldier  were at war  i cant stay home tending the damned olive groves
i want to come home of course i do id have to be mad not to want that its just that marcus trusts me
quintus is overly idealistic
me  well i believe in rome youd have to after what ive seen how people outside the empire treat each other
when you get to ostia use this  bribe passage to africa or spain save my family  you should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to egypt then to numidia
youre not going  you have to stay with us
narcissus
ill never die  you tell the girls that  you honor our ancestors and ill be there  every night  at the table of life
theyll have me  teach them  dont let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history without philosophy without meaning teach them of the greeks the babylonians the hebrews the numidians the egyptians and the great romans  teach them who we are
youre a legate in the roman army huh  and you act like one what was your crime
who the hell are you
condemned  arent i owed a trial before being condemned
thank you  what is going to happen tomorrow  exactly
death is a very light thing for you
take your hands off me animal
sorry but i have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise i wont even get back the cost of the bribe i had to pay the arena slaves to get you here  i know what youre trying to do  kill yourself and trust in the roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands  the only thing you have accomplishes is to prove youre a very important individual  you make me feel good about my investment  and that puking pig jerses  he wont even discuss you  both of you have clamped mouths  but i love all my fighters  ill find out about your family  and about you  that i promise
legate narcissus meridas general of the spanish felix legions  im proud to have you in my school  now show them what you can do
general do you realize what happened out there today
at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company  small but profitable  they asked if you would endorse their oil  we could get some very nice posters  make some very big money
general hang on drink slowly you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight  a fan sent them to you
proximo if this is her doctor hes an assassin
it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet it belonged to cimon of smyrna he was crushed by an elephant
no more bad luck now  the people are anticipating you  i have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior  the true roman  the man who fought side by side with the wolf of rome
tigers challenged you and jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer  you take a fall
you put this inside your shirt  when tiger stabs your stomach  its full of pigs blood  gushes out everywhere  its really impressive  fantastic  better than the real thing
you get to come alive again in the country
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life
but  you have to go out there ill give you more than your one third  when i get paid just take the fall  youre too hurt to fight and the mans a killer
tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth  take my advice and make that bet
how much money is involved
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right they dont waste time
no  tell them ill do it  but i want more posters all over rome
then get a large cash advance
before they leave get gold
i want another interview with cos tell him to bring plenty of ink
so things change  the government has moved to the circus  youre going to fight last  and commodus is going to fight first
lets talk about this later  right now we have other things to settle you and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to ostia  from there caesar has decreed you be given an estate in paestum  its beautiful an old greek town right on the ocean  rich soil  perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements although caesar will give you a sort of pension its always good to look to the future keep your hand in the arena so to speak
commodus must hate you  free your gladiators and come with us

now  do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time
good i mean are we dead or something
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together
im not no but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then
anything anything at all
oh my god
leave it on now we are going to do this thing we are going to have a conversation think of another topic
art thats a good subject you start it off
oh
yes i do i know quite a bit about it
are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art
youre not interested in art
then why do you want to talk about it
can i take off my clothes now
do you really want me to
do you want to hear it or not
i got up i ate breakfast and went shopping during the afternoon i read a novel
what
then i fixed supper for my husband and waited until 
what
him
there isnt any
how do you get out of the house
what do you say to him
always
please now tell me how do you know he wont wake up sometime and follow you
but what about the noise from the car what if 
were talking
were talking mrs robinson were talking
now lets keep going here
right
now you say the driveways on your side of the house so i guess you dont sleep in the same room
so you dont  i mean i dont like to seem like im prying but i guess you dont sleep together or anything
well how long has this been going on
oh no are you kidding me
you have not slept with your husband for five years
how many times a year
man is this interesting
so you dont love him you wouldnt say you 
wait a minute so you wouldnt say you loved him
but you dont hate him
well how do you feel about him then
well thats kind of a bad situation then isnt it
well you loved him once i assume when you first knew him
what
why did you do that
well i cant
i cant see why you did unless you didnt have to marry him or anything did you
oh no you had to marry him because you got pregnant
well i never thought of you and mr robinson as the kind of people who
wait a minute wait a minute so how did it happen
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances
and you were a student also
at college
what was your major
because im interested mrs robinson now what was your major subject at college
but i thought you  i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then
well how did it happen
i mean did he take you up to his room with him did you go to a hotel
im curious
oh no in the car you did it
what kind of car was it
do you remember the make of the car
really i want to know
a ford a ford goddamnit a ford thats great
dont talk about elaine
no
i wish youd tell me
well  i guess ill have to ask her out on a date and find out whats 
do you understand that
good
good
i have my reasons
no
im not good enough for her to associate with am i im not good enough to even talk about her am i
were not dropping it now thats the reason isnt it im a dirty degenerate arent i im not fit to 
im good enough for you but im too slimy to associate with your daughter thats it isnt it isnt it
you go to hell you go straight to hell mrs robinson do you think im proud of myself do you think im proud of this
well im not
no sir i am not proud that i spend my time with a brokendown alcoholic
because  mrs robinson this is the sickest most perverted thing that ever happened to me and you do what you want but im getting the hell out
that im a sick and disgusting person
what
dont you expect me to be a little hurt
did i say that
benjamin i want to apologize to you if thats the impression you got
i didnt mean it i dont think youd be right for each other but i would never say you werent as good a person as she is
what are you doing
well look  i was kind of upset there  im sorry i said those things
but its not
oh no  look  i like you i wouldnt keep coming here if i didnt like you
its not i enjoy it i look forward to it its the one thing i have to look forward to
well i wouldnt i would never say it if it wasnt true
yes please i want you to
look why the hell did you bring this up it never occurred to me to take her out
this is absurd
all right for christs sake i promise i will never take out elaine robinson
now listen  this was not my idea it was my fathers idea
look well go out to dinner and have a drink and ill bring her back because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families and im afraid i couldnt quite handle that if you dont mind i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life so dont get upset about it
drive down the block
now it seems to me 
mrs robinson 
how
i dont believe you
mrs robinson dont wreck it im asking you please not to wreck it
hello get me the police please
what have you done to her
you cant stop me from seeing her mrs robinson ill find her

im not but im  im not very proud of what i do i usually get kind of drunk i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk then i take a hotel room so i wont have to drive home on the freeway i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after 
you believe me dont you
but i want you to please please will you believe me
its pretty embarrassing i really dont know what to tell mr robinson its awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine
dont go on like this now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out 
im going up to berkeley today
they dont know
well  when did you decide all this
when did you two talk this over
im just 
well 
i guess  about my future
i dont know i want it to be 
why
have you thought about graduate school
would you mind telling me then  what were those four years of college for what was the point of all that hard work
i guess shes not good enough for you is that it
how do you know you havent seen her since high school i guess your evenings whatever you do with them are just too valuable
say that again
come on lets call the robinsons weve got something to celebrate
wait a minute you talked to elaine this morning
she doesnt know that youre coming up to berkeley
ben  this whole idea sounds pretty halfbaked
i drove  i drove mrs robinson home she wanted me to drive her home so i  i drove her home

i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you mr robinson i am trying to tell you i do not resent you
no i dont
but why

your madness is another mans greatness  this is the way things have always been  youve just been too blinded by your own reality to see  but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways  you always did come through  our loyal watch dog finding him bringing him back to us once hed finished his work  although after you had that nasty stroke the last time i had to go after him myself  and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar
she has the gift  the blood of thorn running through her veins  michaels mother had it too  so for six years i incubated her prepared her for this night  michael has served his purpose  and soon we will have a new progeny
there you go trying to make sense again  its a curse  handed down through countless generations as ageless as this celebration which you call halloween
youve created a monster
no
yes
im sorry but do i know you 
yes  tommy  what are you doing here

im liable to find anything
i know i know  i dunno  at least shes in the same house  sure was spooky looking in the window there and there she was
you know what gets me
how short the skirts are
you know what gets me  those guys who went to the moon  to the moon boy

you ever own a motorcycle
and how were things
otherwise how are things
could have happened to anybody
i dunno boy
i guess  youre lucky you dont have any old people around here
whats funny about that
excuse me
huh
hes a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesnt wear anything but a jockstrap
you told me
when we were up in the tree so longwith the bats
fourteen times you told me  i counted
youd get this funny look in your eyes and id say to myself oh jesushes going to tell me what a retiarius is again
go to the funeral
thats against the law isnt it i cant wear a uniform anymore
alice would be absolutely tearass
i didnt know we had any women left
i told you the uniform wouldnt help
so kidhow they hanging  or dont you say that to a little kid
of course youll go  youre going to fly the helicopter
youre so low  look at that beautiful red meat  you havent touched it
all the more reason to go to africa
you know her for what she is now garbage
hi penelope
go live in a safedeposit boxwith your things looseleaf jesusi wouldnt want to be married to him  you know
i wouldnt want to be married to me were too crazy  you know
i didnt like that violin thing that was sad
you never played a violin
yeah  i practically forgot  but after you busted that thing i got to thinking jesusmaybe ill start the violin again that didnt just belong to woodly  that belonged to everybody  maybe he would have sold it to me and i could have some fun  after you busted the violin boy and penelope walked out i thought to myself jesuswho could blame her
me
okay  okay
i know you think that
anybody whod drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb
i dont think so  it could have been
if i hadnt done it  if id said to myself screw it  im going to let all those people down there live
yeah jesusbut wars would be a lot better i think if guys would say to themselves sometimes jesusim not going to do that to the enemy  thats too much you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there even though you dont know how to make a violin just by not busting it up  i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki and the mother too just by not dropping the bomb  i sent em to heaven insteadand i dont think there is one
hello
is penelope in
i wanted to apologize
i forgot my vacuum cleaner
i cant get over how you guys are my friends  harold ryan and looseleaf harper are my friends
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin
blue soup
are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die
would somebody please pass me the catsup
insurance
what an awful sound
its possible of course that youll die in africa
selling vacuum cleaners isnt the best preparation you could have
fifty years
im interested in longterm expectations
if i were married to him i sure wouldnt walk out
whos going to fly our helicopter now
we got to get another pilot
for africa
you invited me
what went wrong
gee whiz
i wouldnt drop my gun
im smarter than looseleaf
how do you know how id act in africa
youre my buddy
no matter what you say to me i still think youre the greatest guy i ever knew
youyou arent going to have any friends left if you dont watch out
anybody home
sir
hello
you were about to ask a question
ask it
life has denied me that thrill
mind  god yes i mind  im your fathers friend  a man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago
dr woodly  i should make a little list
the doctor was called away on an emergency  i think it was birth
you dont know where your mother is does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night
you think you could find me a pencil and paper
and youve been roaming the streets while your mother is godknowswhere
man and boy
even thisherb shuttle you said
ah  and what sort of man is this worshiper
i see  and he came into the apartment one day to demonstrate his wares and your mother as it happened was charmingly en deshabille
college
college
what a pity  educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch  everything stops  and the doctor  he worships your father too
excellent
it makes life spicy
no
what does he doof an athletic nature
aha  he has a brilliant military record im sure
big ones little ones teenyweeny onesjust and otherwise
dad  dad  the boy wants tales of derringdo name a country
oh hell
behind a desk for a little while  a desk  they had him planning air raids  a city cant flee like a coward or fight like a man and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of harold ryan  there was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice and that was making the choice himself  ask about spain where he was the youngest soldier in the abraham lincoln brigade  he was a famous sniper  they called him la picadurathe sting
as in death where is thy sting he killed at least fifty men wounded hundreds more
ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla bandin the war against the nazis
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald the beast of yugoslavia hand to hand
hid by dayfought by night  at sunset one day your father and i peering through field glasses saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn  it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car  out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of historythe beast of yugoslavia
we blacked our hands and faces  at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village  the name of the village was mhravitch remember that name
we came up behind a sentry and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound
dont care for cold steel  a knife is worse than a bullet
the story gets hairier  should i stop
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane  your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire  your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire  thats nicer than a knife isnt itas long as you dont look at the face afterwards  the face turns a curious shade of avocado  i must ask the doctor why that is  at any rate we stole into the back of the inn and with the permission of the management we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there
we carried cyanide capsules  we were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured  it was your fathers opinion that the krauts needed them more than we did at the time
mhravitch  remember that name
the name will live forever  it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia  mhravitch
its rather a disappointment these days  it isnt there any more
the germans shot everybody who lived there then leveled it plowed it planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia  to their twisted way of thinking your father had butchered an eagle scout  play lots of contact sports
youre supposed to get hurt
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that
he seems to think they are  he told me that were
youre a very good boy to respond that way
id like to use the sanitary facilities if i may
yes wife it is  come here boy  your father is home
wants to fix up her makeup no doubt
alive and hale  hes throwing a little surprise party for his own family  is your mother often this unstable  penelope
why dont you go to bedson
tomorrows another day paul you know what my english literature teacher said about you
she said you were legendary  i wrote a theme about you and she said your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes
tomorrows saturday  anyway shes dead
she was killed in the park two months agoin the daytime
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society and they got her

i dont know what i hope  but i dont think you care what i hope anyway  you dont know me  you dont know her either  i dont think you know anybody  you talk to everybody just the same
how do you do  my name is penelope ryan  this is a simpleminded play about men who enjoy killingand those who dont
hamburger heaven
can i help you sir
eighteen  and a half
sir
yes sir  it was a very unusual automobile it was a cadillac but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be  and what to drink
im sorry sir im engaged to be married  my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man
im engaged
you dont even know me
this is crazy
what do you do for a living
some kind of animal
how do you do
not at all
whats the matter
like hugging a lamp post
you were well adjusted to my being dead
what sort of time period do you have in mind  half an hour  an hour
disease
this reunion isnt what i imagined it would be
seemed the most honest way to begin life together againnatural unrehearsed
you feel that youre behaving as a woman should
bluh
whats that all about
your old beau
i dont want that chancre mechanic in here
we all are
when im dead  or fucking
you know what i want  i want you both to be friends  i know you both respect you both you should be friends
im so glad you like each other  i was so scared so scared
harold
please
he doesnt deserve this  you dont know him  it isnt fair
awful  i cant tell you how sorry i am
now thats what i call fun
youll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again  you used to eat it up
we were one hell of a pairand well be one again  what we need is a honeymoon  lets start right now
he hasnt had breakfast yet
honeymoon  honeymoon  say it honeymoon
you used to like it stark
nowturn around if you would
im going to touch your shoulders very gently now  you mustnt scream  so tense so tense
youre thinking with your brain instead of your body  thats why youre so tense  forget norbert relax  its body time
i have some change
breakfast
and lots of orange juiceoceans of orange juice
all rightbring me a side order of mrs wheeler  oh hellsit down colonel penelope will bring you some chow
which one
shes up in heaven now  she didnt hear  she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness  theres nothing nicer than that  chow  harold ryan wants chow
honeymoon temporarily canceled  the boy should still go out and exercise  i have the impression he never gets any exercise  he simply bloats himself with fig newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators
chow chow chow  god damn it nutriment
cook by god  cook  youre the nigger now
dont lecture me on race relations i dont have a molecule of prejudice  ive been in battle with every kind of man there is ive been in bed with every kind of woman there isfrom a laplander to a tierra del fuegian if id ever been to the south pole thered be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me  cook
people now have dignity when frying eggs
i should have torn that door off its hinges  should have scrogged her ears off  should have broken the bed  what do you want  well
let me guessbreakfast is served
what then
thats what youre supposed to say
you dont know you want  thats the way god built you
it couldnt
fish cant feel
such as
tell me about its sexual roots
i like the truth  i wouldnt be alive today if i werent one of the biggest fans truth ever had
go on
you learned this in some college course
the doctor
and what is his most cherished possession
and he keeps it in his apartment
and no ones there now
thats too bad  i would rather have him at hometo see what im going to do
he did his best to destroy my most precious possession which is the high opinion women have of me  im now going to even that score  im going to break in his door and im going to smash his violin
why not
i came for my clothes
i rang  it seemed like the proper door for a servile worthless organism to use
i came for paul as well
you took him to the funeral i hear
a dozen
did you like it dear
unless she has nerve
he knows you shattered his violin
he cried
two hundred years old
he had hoped that someone would be playing it stilltwo hundred years from now
things
wellwhat have we here  a family
goodbye goodbye goodbye
money  theres plenty of that mildred got the brewery  youll probably get the baseball team
testimonials of that sort areare beyond my range  i dont do them well  thats a failing i know
see how youve upset him  he was so merry and hale before you came home
hell play with his rifle i expect that will cheer him up
i bought him a twentytwo yesterdayon the way home from hamburger heaven  and where is the good doctor  have you two feathered a love nest somewhere
last i heard his mother was going alone
and you a supposedly healthy woman do not detest him for his cowardice
what kind of a country has this become  the men wear beads and refuse to fightand the woman adore them  americas days of greatness are over  it has drunk the blue soup
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink  it put us in a hazea honeycolored haze which was lavender around the edge  we laughed we sang we snoozed  when a bird called we answered back every living thing was our brother or our sister we thought looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long and we cried  we had a funeral that went on for five daysfor the cockroach  i sang oh promise me can you imagine where the hell did i ever learn the words to oh promise me  looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b36  all the time we were drinking more blue soup more blue soup  never stopped drinking blue soup  blue soup all the time wed go out after food in that honeycolored haze and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender
beautiful you say  it wasnt life it wasnt deathit wasnt anything  beautiful  seven years gone  like that like that  seven years of silliness and random dreams seven years of nothingness when there could have been so much
hes a child
youre begging him to kill you
thats really what you want  you become furious when people wont make you dead
so he can kill you  you hate your own life that much  you beg for a hero to kill you
no you dont
honor i suppose
but its all balled up in your head with death  the highest honor is death  when you talk of these animals one by one you dont just talk of killing them  you honored them with death  haroldit is not honor to be killed
its still just death the absence of lifeno honor at all  its worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness  to you though its the honor that crowns them all
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this haroldthe new heroes who refuse to fight theyre trying to save the planet theres no time for battle no point to battle anymore
no
and my son the only son of harold ryanhes going to grow up to be a vanisher too
im going to call the police
this is suicide  go get the police
no we wont  no matter how it begins it will end in death because it always does  isnt that always how it ends haroldin death
im turning off the alarm  im turning off everything
i want you to get out of here norbert  haroldi want you to sit down in the chair and not lift a finger until norbert is gone

tough luck  youll have to split the fee
i feel the same way  what next

well nowwhat seems to be the trouble with the patient today  a touch of malaria perhaps
youve been bitten by bats
you have chills
you can also describe its cure im eating its cure
pacqualinincheewa root
pacqualinincheewa root  means cougar fang cures anything but a yellow streak down the back

good lord
i thought she was a widow
im going to have to report you to the department of health
it died for your sins
theres a certain amount of information there
this is man to man
what brought you back
theres going to be no bloodshed here  i know how hell fightthe only way he can fight with words the truth  am i correct
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers  but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words the truth  correct
what an hallucination  oh dear dear dear dear  oh dearie me
you intend to crack my eardrums with your voice  will i bleed from my every orifice  who will clean up this awful mess
youre a filthy rotten bastard
youre oldso old
a living fossil  like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs
youre a son of a bitch
i havent told you harold how comical i think you are
hands and knees you say
youre in one hell of a jam  you realize that
glands  youre supposed to be happy when you die  call me comical again
i love you  have a cigar
im to be left behindin primordial ooze
this is going to become very physical  are you prepared for that
im an honorable clown
you hope
no quarter asked  no quarter given
cut me open  find out
with spittle
i put a poisoned thought in your head  even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind  its saying obsolete obsolete obsolete and clown clown clown
you have a very good mind or i wouldnt have come back  that mind is now asking itself cleverly and fairly is harold ryan really a clown and the answer is yes
you can never take yourself seriously again  look at all the creatures youve protected us from did you shoot them on the elevator as they were on their way up here to eat us alive
i see
don quixote
something seems to have happened to my selfrespect
the new hero is you
youre too modest
was i ever of use
here  finish the job
youre making a mistake  obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded  youve wounded me
we never quit fighting until were dead
im going to shoot you now
my selfrespect is goneand my soldiers honor with it  it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man
like the sabertoothed tiger
can i beg for mercyon my knees
what is this thing that kills me
dont shoot
no  no
no
cant do it
thank youfor my life
new lives begin

you were harold ryans third wife right
you want to join the harold ryan fan club  wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back
because he was cruel
ach soooooooooo mildred no grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation  harold would come home trumpeting and roaring  he would the kick the furniture with his boots spit into corners and the fireplace  he would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them he would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him and hed tear off my clothes  he would carry me into the bedroom telling me to scream and kick my feet  that was very important to him  i did it  i tried to be a good wife  he told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo  i couldnt do that but i pretended i did  it was all overten seconds after hed said the word buffalo then hed zip up his pants and go outside and tell true war stories to the little kids  any little kids
is it  i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things

i know
oh paul

not even mutual of omaha thinks so anymore
thank you kind sir
a what kind of doctor
thats an interesting piece of news
not true
you know she has no feet  you want him to abandon his mother who has no husband who has no money of her own who has no feet
in a railroad accident many years ago
norbert was just beginning practice a real man would have sold her to a catfood company i suppose  as far as that goes j edgar hoover still lives with his mother
a lot of people dont
i dont really know
i hate that thing
where will you be

everything stays as it is
my father

i hate that thing
it came yesterday  i havent opened it yet
i didnt get his name  a friend of your father
he isnt
please
i keep having this nightmarethat he catches us
hed kill me  hed be right to kill me toothe kind of guy he is
hed assume we had
all through the day im so confident  thats why im such a good salesman you know  i have confidence and i look like i have confidence and that gives other people confidence  people laugh sometimes when they find out im a vacuum cleaner salesman  they stop laughing though when they find out i made fortythree thousand dollars last year  ive got six other salesmen working under me and what they all plug into is my confidence  thats what charges them up
i was captain of the wrestling team at lehigh university
if you want to wrestle you got lehigh  if you want to play tennis you go to vanderbilt
yes
this conversation took place incidentally about three months before harold was declared legally dead
im touched
i see
coming
gentlemen  is this right for a fight  its been so long
what then
did you see him
is he all right
is he coming home
the park
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another
then i saw this bakery store that was still open so i bought a birthday cake
for harold  when paul comes home we can have some birthday cake
did you talk to paul
weve got to find him  i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last  and you stay here norbert in case he comes home  thats all he saidthe thing about the key

whats the matter now
possibly
a week  we were waiting for the right time to
im sorry
thank you herb  youre a wonderful man  you really are everybody respects you for what youve done for scouting and the little league
im saying noand thank you
you were wonderful
its true
you and harold are friends
i am dr norbert woodlya physician a healer  i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society  gentleness must replace violence everywhere or we are doomed
herb shuttle is taking me to a fight
we made the date three months ago
the animals made her sneeze and cry too much
they made her so sleepy she couldnt work
war is not healthy for children and other living things how lovely
oh no  wear a coat of cottonwear a coat of wool

this is very good for us
the wilder paul is tonight the calmer hell be tomorrow
after this explosion i think hell be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again
weve got to dump shuttle  he brings his vacuum cleaner on dates
the what
what kind of a life is that
if you warned him against it as much as you say its almost a certainty
i wish paul luck
id be dead by now if that were the case
every night penelope for the past two years ive made it a point to walk through the park at midnight
to show myself how brave i am  the issues in doubt you knowsince im always for peace
me too  i know something not even the police knowwhats in the park at midnight  nothing  or when im in there theres me in there fear and nobody and me
they didnt murder me
he can make the sound of human footstepswhich is a terrifying sound
if he is in the park luck is all that can save him now and theres plenty of that
no  but hes going to be  if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side i can say to him you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight  on that we can build
thats been said before
you know each other
thank you  thank you very much

they were here
what does that mean  what does he do
you have to believe in something what do they believe in  the whatjamacillit church
do they believe in reincarnation i believe in reincarnation
what the crap
yeah yeah go on
be that as it may u is for unconditional election god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved the elect and he has chosen them from the beginning of time l is for limited atonement only a limited number will be atoned will go to heaven
i can stop if you want
i is for irresistible grace gods grace cannot be resisted or denied and p is for the perseverance of the saints once you are in grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect and thats the tulip
he has to thats predestination if god is omniscient if he knows everything  and he wouldnt be god if he didnt  then he must have known even before the creation of the world the names of those who would be saved
more or less
out of gratitude for being chosen thats where grace comes in god first chooses you then allows you by grace to choose him of your own free will
yeah  well mostly
ill admit its confusing from the outside youve got to see it from the inside
its not quite the same thing

what owners harold we dont uownu anything its a transitory world we come on the earth with nothing and we go out with nothing so isnt ownership a little absurd
its all memorabilia but incidental and not integral if you know what i mean

why not
dont you think we should get some tools maybe
oh my were too late
well come back in the morning
an ice sculpture its venus  the goddess of love the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream

did confucius say that
you are the wisest person i know
yes i havent lived  ive died a few times
died seventeen times  not counting maiming  shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood
well its a question of timing and the right equipment and plenty of patience you really want to hear about this
yes i understand a lot of people enjoy being dead but they are not dead really theyre just backing away from life  theyre players  but they sit on the bench the game goes on before them at any moment they can join in  reach out take a chance get hurt maybe but play as well as you can  go team go give me an l give me an i  give me a v give me an e live  otherwise youll have nothing to talk about in the locker room
look at that sky  its so big
and beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos
maude do you pray
with god
this is really nice makes me feel like a kid i want to do somersaults 
no id feel stupid
want to join me in some cartwheels
its sinking harold going over the horizon  where we are all going to go its getting dark let each man hold on to his candle and get a light whereer he can
from the guys who got the matches of course 
oh harold you make me feel like a schoolgirl
oh
maude i must speak to you
theyre going to draft me in the army im going to be sent away
but they have
but theyll put me in jail
theyd put you in jail eh well historically youd be in very good company  thats what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo would you like to do a little raking  work im told done with no selfish interest purifies the mind you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self on the other hand senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided
dont you talk to me like that you little foul mouth degenerate  really sir i thought that you at least
dont you advance on me
just like this
that wasnt very scary
oh you werent scared
how about some candy floss
you sure have a way with people
look at the stars
do you think there is any life up there
science thinks there isnt that we are all alone in the universe
you should have been a poet
 end where i began
yes
why are there no photographs in these frames
why
it looks like you thanks
i was remembering how much this meant to me it was after the war i had nothing except my life how different i was then  and yet how the same
supper for two
its all right its organic
 which i hope will make you very happy
farewell
but youre not going anywhere are you
oh harold what a fuss this is  so unnecessary
but harold we begin to die as soon as we are born what is so strange about death its no surprise its part of life its change
i feel giddy
oh harold dont upset yourself so
and this too shall pass away
chardin dame marjorie but you may call me maude
please dont you realize she is dying
of course harolds father had a similar sense of the absurd i remember once in paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next i hear hes arrested for floating nude down the seine  experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings well that cost quite a little bit of enfluence and dargent to hush up i can tell you harold dear stop playing with your food dont you feel well
mother
mother
mother im going to get married
im getting married
i suppose you think this is very funny harold
love love what do you uknowu about her where does she come from where did you meet her
oh thats wonderful i get an eightyyearold pallbearer for a daughterinlaw be reasonable harold youre dealing with your life what will people say
im going to marry the woman i love
this is insane
how do you do
would you like a cigarette
is sunshine your real name
do you play
oh is this your father
this one is particularly interesting its a harikari blade
an ancient japanese ceremony
tell me harold how many of these eh suicides have you performed
and why is that
just give me a rough estimate
fifteen
and were they all done for your mothers benefit
i dont think im getting through to mother like i used to
yes it does
i put a lot of effort into these things
and a lot of time
no
my mother spoke to my uncle victor hes in the army and he fixed it up
you mean when im not working on a
i see junkyards what is the fascination there
is it the machines the noise the people
thats very interesting harold and i think very illuminative there seems to be a definite pattern emerging  your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state your selfdestructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction what do you think and of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution but tell me what do you do for ufunu what activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others what do you find fulfilling what gives you that certain satisfaction
harold
you dont seem to be listening i asked do you have any friends
none at all
would you care to talk about this friend
is this a friend you had when you were away at school
i see  were you happy at school harold
you liked your teachers
your classmates
your studies
then why did you leave
we are not relating today harold i sense a definite resistance a lack of true and helpful communication i find you a very interesting case harold but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psychoanalytical process and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment do you understand
i see tell me harold do you remember your father at all
why
what would you say
good idea of yours to come out here harold its a lovely spot
call me sir harold first thing you learn in the army  an officer deserves your respect
lets examine the facts on it i say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war i say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy hell world war ii gave us the ballpoint pen thats common knowledge
is that a fact well that fits in right along with everything ive been saying war is not all black
and so i ask you  why the hell did we give up on the germans those damn politicians in washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace hell look at history the two best wars this country has fought were against the jerries now i say get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong and lets get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support
they came at me from all sides hundreds of em we kept firing  zattattattat throw the grenades i shouted mac throw the grenades hes dead joe said and kept right on feeding me bullets  zattattattat  they kept falling but they kept coming bullets whizzing all around me zot joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head i thought i was done for but i kept firing zattattat only one thought kept me going kill kill for mac and joe and the rest of the guys kill  a blinding flash i wake up on a stretcher did we hold i asked the medic yes sir he said and i slipped into unconsciousness
well youll soon have stories like that to tell of your own
sure be able to tell your children something for them to look up to be proud of
its the greatest excitement in the world
thats right
the moment of truth
yes
will they really teach me to shoot
and to use the bayonet pachoie
how about handtohand combat
to strangle someone choke him squeeze out his life between your hands
how about to slit his throat
id like that you could see the blood squirt out
sir how about souvenirs
of your kill  ears nose scalp privates
boy to think i could maybe make my own
parasite
harold calm down this is
stay where you are harold

right  why
oh  okay
what i mean is i didnt mean you look young  you dont  you dont look old either  you look just as old as you are  a bit younger maybe but not a lot  not much  just right
right  so  you must have an enormous record collection
yeah well lets see what are youre alltime top five records
your desert island topfive
is there a difference
nevermind  any five  so four more
well if one of them is this sin city thing 
oh im sure i can manage something sin city new rose by the damned hit it and quit it by funkadelic shipbuilding elvis costello japanese import no horns or different horns anyway um mystery train by elvis presley and spaced cowboy by sly and the family stone  a bit controversial i know but
is that it
sure but is that it for the list
well it was a friends idea really and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it  so  i should really put a james brown in there 
yeah
who  oh  my friend  my friend is laura  a girl  a friend whos a girl
okay dance music for old people
and the new label  and the kinky wizards
would you  really  wow  i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home

fantastic but im a little busy right now  listen  do you want to come to dinner saturday  im having some friends over and i need a spare man are you a spare man
hey charlie
why did you break up with me for marco
huh
its all kind of lost in the in the dense mists of time now it wasnt that i really liked marco more  in fact i thought you were more shall we say attractive than him  it was just that he knew he was goodlooking and you didnt and that made a difference somehow  you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you and that got kind of beat if you know what i mean  your selfimage started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange  and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful you made me laugh and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved and marco seemed a bit more i dont know glamorous more sure of himself  less hard work because i felt like i was dragging you around sort of  a little sunnier  sparkier  i dont know  you know what people are like at that age  they make very superficial judgements  do you think thats superficial  he was a clown if its any consolation
morning dick
good weekend
great
no thats okay  really
yeah i havent really absorbed that one
whats this
hey  didnt you steal that one already
are you all right
ive ah got some other stuff to tell him anyway so its no problem ill just tell him about you know laura when i tell him the other stuff
or rather bad news and good news because he likes this person playing tonight  i mean he liked laura too i didnt mean that  and he likes you  its just that 
i always hated this song
lets not
rob
rob 
i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux
well we rang 900 today
dont worry about it dick  barrys an asshole
im sorry rob thats its 
can i do anything
what is this
laura  are you okay
yeah im fine  im off the phone
im upset but im fine
mmmm no  not a good idea
can i help you
what needs sorting out
funnily enough i havent been too thrilled about it
yeah well ive stopped all that now
yeah
i dunno
good  so shall we leave it at that then
good  so shall we leave it at that then
so shall we leave it at that then
you dont have to go this second you can stay until whenever
jeez  he goes on long enough
shit
hi
are you coming home
how can you like art garfunkel and marvin gaye  its like saying you support the israelis and the palestinians
 made  made  marvin gaye is dead his father shot him in 
 alright alright but 
hey  marvin gaye got to give it up thats our song  marvin gaye is responsible for our entire relationship
but dont you remember
you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now when i first met you and i made you that tape you loved it  you said  and i quote  it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection
so you werent interested in music at all
but laura thats me  thats all there is to me  there isnt anything else  if youve lost interest in that youve lost interest in everything
yes  look at me  look at our  the apartment  what else do i have other than records and cds
have you tackled the great reorganization yet
so  where have you been staying for the last week
im sorry  i havent been very fair to you  thats why i came here to the store this evening  i feel terrible rob  this is really hard you know
what  gimme a fucking break  is that what you think  that your not big enough a deal for me  jesus gimme a little credit rob
what were the others
whats the obvious stuff
i guess its not that obvious then
what
did you say something
rob  dont be childish
i am not living with him  ive just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what im doing look this has nothing to do with anyone else  you know that dont you  i left because we werent exactly getting along and we werent talking about it  and i suddenly realized that i like my job and i like what my life is could be turning into and that im getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i cant really see that ever happening with you and yeah yeah i sort of get interested in someone else and that went further than it should have so it seemed like a good time to go  but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run  probably nothing
look  maybe youll grow up and well get it together you and me  maybe ill never see either of you again i dont know  all i know is that its not a good time to be living here
i dont know
i suppose so
oh rob shut up
well if you could tell me roughly it would help
yeah  great
no problem  if i can ask one question
it sounds stupid
you wont like it
is it better
well  sex i guess  is sex with him better
of course it is
i dont know
never
but not even before when he was living upstairs
the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you havent done it was him yet
hi
ill look for em  how you doing
fine im sure its in the file at home  ill call you when i find it and then well talk
so how are you
i told you i slept with him
is that why you wanted to see me
oh rob  what do you want me to say
you kind of have to start with elvis costello but where motel matches i want you i hope youre happy now green shirt his records should be sealed in cases that say in case of vicious betrayal smash glass where did you sleep last night sure but by robert johnson or by nirvana  maybe a liz phair track  there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with some devils advocate stuff  the silver jews could be good when youre ready to start putting it all behind you  but i think were getting ahead of ourselves there  ah  dylan bob fucking dylan  now bob dylan would the phone rings  he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing
and anyway i keep trying to tell you thats not really the point is it  the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess rob  are you there  what are you thinking
we can meet for another drink if you want  so i can explain it better i owe you that much
will you call me
call me at work  we can arrange to meet properly  i dont want this to be the last conversation we have  i know what youre like
hello
i figured it was  where are you
are you still in love with me
think about what i said  i mean if you want to experiment or whatever 
i dont want to  dont need to  i love you
i called and called but you were out  i thought id be gone before you got back
yep  i might have missed some stuff im so used to some things being here that i dont even notice them
hes at home  listen i cant believe he went to the store  im mortified actually  im really sorry  he had no right to do that and i told him so
im sure
i dont really want to talk about it to be honest
fix it up  itll make you feel better
you know i didnt mind  and its not as if rays place is any better
ray  i hate ian
this is where youre supposed to say that you havent laughed this much in ages and then you see the error of your ways
you know im a good person
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it
dont forget your cds
sure they are
okay okay  i get the picture
i got it  you like sting but you dont like gram parsons because youve never heard of him
i guess i am
hello
guess who i just saw right by my store  ian  in starbucks  neat huh
are you alright
dont worry about it  just get into bed  worry about that when youre better
who the fucks pig
im sorry
me
do you want me to be there
look are you coming or not
lizll give you a lift  she knows where to go and everything i dont have time to talk rob  ive got too much to do
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night
youre soaking
i can see why you say that  look im sorry  i really am  the last thing i wanted was thats why i left because i lost it and i didnt want to blow my top in there and look the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared  i just wanted you to know thats all
what do you mean
sure i understand  look i dont want to take up any more of your time  you get back and ill wait here for a bus
what do you want to do
when are you going back
what
ive only got a couple left  im saving them for later
hello  it doesnt seem so long ago that i looked at you from here
you know with ray
no no  its not are you still on the pill
look we can do other things
laura
so if you had a bit more energy wed stay split  but things being how they are what with you wiped out youd like us to get back together
what about ian
mission accomplished
lets go home  okay
cmon  i want to know
what it was like
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex
you know the difference
oh cmon laura  just say something lie if you want  itd stop me asking you questions and itd make me feel better
well why the fuck would you want to lie anyway
look rob  if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we wouldnt be lying here now and that is my last word on the subject okay
 like mexico  or jamaica  or new york even
ill pay for you  even though you owe me money  we have to do something with the money i earn  i need to i deserve it  you can just think of it as winning the lottery
money does not matter  i do not care how much you earn  id just like you to be a little happier in your work but beyond that you can do what you like
how  how were we the same people
because im not allowed to  i still do after work  so what  should we just break up  is that what youre saying  because if you are im going to run out of patience
but what
you havent changed so much as a pair of socks in the years ive known you  if weve grown apart then im the one whos done the growing and all ive done is change jobs
i cant go to work with my hair dyed pink  and i can afford to go shopping more now and ive met a couple people i like over the last year or so
more confident maybe
less neurotic  are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life
yeah youre alright  but youre certainly not happy  so what happens if you get happy  and yes i know thats the title of an elvis costello album i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention should we split up because im used to you being miserable  what happens if you i dont know start youre own record label and its a success time for a new girlfriend
all im saying is you have to allow for things to happen to people most of all to yourself  otherwise whats the use
hi
nothing
where
oh  well  we dont really get along paul and i
you did that deliberately  you knew all along id like them  it was a trick
i called dan koretzky because he 
yeah and he said its a good way to break out a record  especially for what he said and i quote would be a highly anticipated event locally he helped me put out a press release
just local of course
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we werent together anymore  it might even be why i came back
what do you ever do that cant be cancelled
barry said its done
theyll go on early  nobody will even be there yet and i told them they cant play for more than a half hour
im sorry ive been acting like a jerk  i do appreciate what youve done for me and i know youve done it for the best possible reasons and i do love you even though i act like i dont
are you worried about tomorrow night
are you going to talk to me or shall i get my paper out
what are you going to talk to me about
ha ha ha  hoo hoo hoo
i know
im sorry  but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader werent you
well forgive me if i dont think of you as the worlds safest bet
no  probably not
dont sulk  what brought all this on
very persuasive
no  i dont think so  im just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days fair enough
so
about what
ive changed my mind  thats the most romantic thing ive ever heard i do  i will
i mean maybe youre right  but were you really expecting me to say yes
im an idiot  i should have played the record first  this place is about to get burned down
rob here
whats happenin
yeah  i just wanted to thank you for that message last night  it made me feel like like less of an asshole
actually im fine  im great last night i got to thinking you know what  maybe it is time to move on  maybe were just not right for each other  or maybe we are  but time will tell and at this point im going to be fine with whatevers meant to be you know
whats the  hey liz 
to think i sympathized with you for two seconds  poor rob  laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs  you let me believe that
rob  two years ago you got laura pregnant you then proceeded to cheat on her  you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back  and then just a few weeks ago you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else
so the minister says nice things and then what we all troop outside and they bury him
youre kidding  a crematorium jesus
is ray going
enough liz
i know i cant speak now because lauras father died and i just have to take it because otherwise im a bad guy with the emphasis on guy selfcentered  well im fucking not not all the time anyway im really sorry jo  but you know liz i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself  and maybe you think i should but its not much of a life you know
only because its never the time  i cant go on apologizing my whole life you know
good  cause im enjoying myself
so you live in chicago now
dont you like that
hi marie
she just wanted to pick up some stuff no big thing  a relief actually
its a great song
is that why you came to chicago in the first place  because of you know dividing up your record collection and stuff
you share a place with tbone
awhile back dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like not what you are like
what do you mean the crumblers you know the crumblers  nobodys heard the crumblers  except me
books records films  these things matter  call me shallow but its the damn truth and by this measure i was having one of the best dates of my life
the conformist
you havent even seen it
are you okay
for now  but i wouldnt be if i thought this was the end of the evening
good  in that case ill fix us something else to drink  you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob standing and holding his jacket
id like it if you could stay the night
jesus so much for delicacy  i pegged you for a master of understatement beating around the bush and all that buzz
so youll stay
would you like me to turn the lights out  or would you like them on
which way are you going
that way
ill call you
yeah
hi mom

so so  up and down
she left  shes gone
how would i know  gone  girlfriend leave  not say where gone  laura move out
hello  anybody there
you know thats not whats upsetting me
i knew this would happen  what are you going to do rob
and after that
i knew this was going to happen
what did laura say  do you know why she left
so you say  id like to hear her side of it
what do you think
these are worth at least i dont know 
but you must have 
and you must not be getting along too well right now huh
it must have taken him a long time to get them together
look  can i pay you properly  you dont have to tell him what you got send him fortyfive bucks and blow the rest  give it to charity  or something
look i im sorry  i dont want to be any part of this
thats why im trying to compromise what about fifteenhundred  theyre worth five times that
thirteen hundred
elevenhundred  thats my lowest offer
with eleven hundred he could come home and thats the last thing i want
can i buy this otis redding single off you
oh come on  let me give you ten dollars for this and you can give the rest away for all i care
eno import  sigue sigue sputnik break beats  serge gainsbourg ryuchi sakamoto syd barrett whats going on here  are you guys stealing for other people now

jesus  that things been in the bargain bin for six months  was it just your criminal nature or what hell i wouldve given it to you for free
uh yes i like do its simple you make the tracks  recording studio  deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut the master is then dubbed to submasters which are the mothers as their called for each press in the plant you press the cds or records put in your cover art and thats it

someone beat you
grave robbers
who
i dont know what youre talking about
you have an active imagination
i have friends
jesus christ
why not
he tried to kill me last night
who is he
what will you do now
he called you macleod
i left a man dead in felton  but you dont really care do you
he was innocent
what about me
im a witness to a murder  that seems to put me pretty high on your friends chop list
no
id rather hear yours
im a historian mr taupin only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face
he sees me as a threat
no
no  i had to talk to you
youre wrong
is this what you killed them with
our cars were seen together in felton  theyre calling me an accessory to murder
whats all that
you did kill those men
when you finish what then
you make it all sound so simple
you want me to front for you
there was a man once  just a simple woodcarver  but he understood  more than anyone he could see to the heart of it  it never ends  today is the same as the first  tomorrow will be the same as today  so much time  and all of it wasted  you love history
the estate stuff is pretty straight forward  just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat
no  so what now  we just wait
its some sort of party the town is throwing
maybe it would do us both good
here try this  i suppose theyre still making women the same as back then
i dont know any of these  ill make a fool of myself
william taupin seems to have left his mark
and you are william taupin arent you
youre using your sons name
then you must be at least 70 years old
its frightening sometimes the way you talk about other peoples lives
i hope i never get that old
i must be insane  leaving work ditching cops  all to follow a murderer  a very old murderer but a murderer just the same
ive been telling myself its the award winning journal article im going to write  but its not  its you
im not even sure why
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses  i cant stand it  but youre different  its in your hands  a clarity
who are you
i carried that rifle in world war i  this book is a 16th century policy report for the king of austria  the diploma is my con ference of degree in latin from trinity college  class of 1672  it goes on
yes
he is older than i
sometimes i think its just for something to do  a conquest to be the last  something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away  some thing to replace the love that can never work
perhaps  there is something more an inheritance
i didnt kill the watchman
not the same
sometimes innocents become involved
there are differences
i havent killed you
dont
what is it like  being you
but youre known so much history ill only read about
what is it you want
gettysburgs an hours drive at most  you should be back by nightfall
whats wrong
what is it
get out
the emptyness  the years and years of void  nothingness  bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness who would have guessed
life  it is the gift and the under standing of life
it will be horrible  the future  i may die tomorrow or 10000 tomorrows i can promise you nothing  nothing but a moment  maybe two  but a moment of love is that not worth a lifetime
forget it
arent you getting a little old for this  you flunked out of law school
forgers do it all the time  they take the birth certificate of some one who died young and use it to get legit id  usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it
a murder
ive got a morgue filling up with bodies  thats my right
im calling an attorney
what are you going to tell them  that youre protecting a man whos killed four people
all fashionably without heads
but theres more  wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in felton delaware  some locals spotted two cars with dc plates and surprise surprise they turn out to be registered to our own brenna cartwright and the ever popular richard taupin
youve been a busy little beaver especially with that records mess up in church hill  your notes are very complete naturally my feelings were crushed when you didnt rush right over and tell us what you knew  in fact were considering book ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder
but we might just give it the ole college try  what with the court back ups it could be days before you got an arraignment but then im sure the flunkout neice of the da knows all about that
i want taupin
just for laughs we raided wonder boys house  there was a gallon of one of the corpses blood in his carpet  i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year
what were you doing in felton
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together
come on brenna your ass is already in a sling dont drag me into it
you talked to your supervisor lately  hes burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight  that on top of the cops bugging him
corey you owe me
good way to lose your job
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts too bad no one else did
who is it
i dont believe him
hang on a sec you did your little favor for the boys downtown im sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here
someone should check him out maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over  he has one he might have two
requiem acernam donaei
et lux perpetua
be quiet
stop
afternoon
aye
youre not from these parts
i havent much to offer mr romirez from spain but youre welcome to whats here
your back it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle
your marks would suggest great injury
i did at that
aye
i was driven out
how can you know this
hmm que rico  what is it you call this
you scots have a way with game  it still has life in it spirit  back home the food is sodomestic
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal
in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth
when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me  all thought i would die or be maimed for life  but i healed quickly and like you i paid the price for being different
do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you
does it change with me in the room
you feel you know me
he told me there could be only one
i dont understand
im twentytwo
conor you and i we cannot be killed
it is as you are
listen to me  hear the words
it is the truth
three days youve laid there its time you ate
you are not dead boy  accept it
what is to become of me  am i to wander the earth forever like a ghost
then they were right  i am evil this is gods punishment
why does he want to kill me
aye
but we cannot be killed
how can i stop such a man
why
harder  concentrate harder
harder  you swing like an impotent cow
impotent cow
it will take less effort as you learn
you have a gift  one you must protect
the fabric of life  the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another
youre no match for scot mr romirez  were raised as riders
what is the fascinatioon  it is only a leaf
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes  to feel it to know it is to be in touch with the will of every living thing
it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds  but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening for it gives you great strength  the strength of knowledge  the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be
you have not been fully trained but you will learn  and you will be good i can feel that  you have apt itude  this is why our friend is so concerned
this power is divided amongst you me and others like cuts in a pie but the cuts are not equal  some like you and he have more  much more
i am a small player  but if by helping you i can keep that monster from being the last then perhaps my life has meant something
you must be  you have responsibilities you must learn the rules  you can never attract attention to yourself never show the side that will draw others to you  you will always know when you are in the presence of another  beware but more importantly conor macleod will be your battle against time  in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat  people will become a transitory pathetic lot  the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent  but life without morality without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love is no life at all  that is how the others exist  nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last  keep your soul sewed to the earth  do not become one of them
you are young inexperienced  you do not know what time can do  how it can sap all pity all love
go ahead senor  i have my friend to keep me company
im your future husband remember
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands
you cannot be real conor  you had the last rites  no man has been cut half as bad and lived
live  in less than a week youre prancing about the country like a squirrel
some think not
theres rumor in the village some call it magic
i dont know conor  its not natural  maybe something has touched you
please not be touching me conor
leave me alone conor  please
if you send me away now mara ill not come looking for you
oh please  another one
something pretty
thats wonderful  where did you ever learn it
david
who am i deceiving
state of grace and all that
not so scared
no doubt
youre wrong
romirez understood  not you
finish your prayers
our common heritage  i am your only real friend you know  the only one who truly understands you  i look forward to the day we meet again  and i kill you
complete your inspection
i doubt much can change that the enemy has five brigades waiting for us
eat up dupont  it will probably be your last
your name
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill
what is your position
i understand you joined up in bremen
i am a major private  you would do well remembering that when addressing me
equals
wait  i think we understand each other
help  ive seen others help somehow a head always ended up on the counter
we must talk
dont threaten me private
do not turn your back on me
you see major  you are not so different
ah conor how you look a man
your grandfather wore that in his service to the king and i to fight for the duke
aye  it is his duty  all of ours
here  the hook should go just below the head where the meat is toughest
fish are creatures of habit  they like their food where theyre used to it  at the top hiding in old leaves
my father taught me
i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff
yeah
any other ids come up
should have seen him the first night  son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didnt even blink
are you sure
round up who you can and put them on standby
where
smith  carl smith
the last four
he got him  he always does  eventually
answer me
spare a chair
are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night
how are you
how did you find me
old habits die hard  waitress  a round of nitzhic  peasant drool i know  but its the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence
and have you something to settle with me
ill never forget the look on that papal commanders face when his heretic stronghold turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over neuvich
but then rides up pope pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross climbs off his papal horse draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on  and what did neuvich dear dear drunken neuvich do
had a great swing with his blade for a pope
he found us even there
i havent drunk this much since
i love zoos  ever since i was a kid
i knew his greatgrandfather
no seriously  we used to shoot pool together in rangoon
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have  all else is just marking time  youre marking time
the pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth
long time
youve been here from the start
friend of yours
run
you disappoint me  i thought youd finally gotten over that sort of thing
whats the point
whats the point  you have me finish it
tradition
perhaps miss cartwright would like to play
we have some unfinished business
i want you to come to me
yes laddie i have her
this your present address
mr  taupin what were you doing in that alley
did you know the victim
his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory
two days ago a bulgarian national was murdered the same way  hed also been in the country less than a week  what is your citizenship
do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh borhood at night
what were you looking for
do you know what this is
a claymore to be exact  you wouldnt know anything about it would you
it was covered with mr fasils fingerprints but none of his blood
my condolences
home
look i dont know what the hell youre up to but i think ive got a pretty good idea
all i need is time
ah steven it is good to see you
youre a kind man to be sure
steven conor didnt die
when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept up
youre one of williams kids huh

the resemblance is amazing
morning mr north
such a pretty day  if i live to be 90 ill never tire of mornings like this  mind you im 74 now
yes sir  when you get older your priorities change  its the simple things that count  without them growing old can be a very lonely thing
nothing to be sorry about

oh i realized right away hes really a very nice fellow hildy  i found that out
did you finish the interview
no  but im sure itll be all right with walter
hildy
bruce howd you get out
i waited and waited and then i had an idea and wired albany to send me a hundred dollars so i could get out on bail  i dont know what theyll think  they sent it to the police station
i know i got you into this hildy but it does seem to me that you cant care much for me if youre willing to let me stay locked up for two hours
oh she was here
hildy wheres mother

then suppose you give me the money four hundred and fifty dollars
here it is bruce one  two  three  four hundred  and fifty dollars

oh i thought there was something funny you see bruce you dont mind if i call you bruce do you after all were practically related

but i see she didnt mean old in years you always carry an umbrella bruce
attaboy  come on bruce

well so youre getting married tomorrow eh how does it feel bruce

well ill try to give her one
just for the first year
mighty nice little town albany theyve got the state capitol there you know
hows business bruce
i sometimes wish id taken out insurance  but of course now it doesnt matter still i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do
anything the matter
just what is the lowdown on williams
are you sure williams is not all there
but couldnt you show the man wasnt responsible
how long would the interview take
i never knew hildy to be so determined before
i dont know this makes me feel funny
i feel i ought to take care of her
well im independent too
well of course if you put it that way
im beginning to realize that
gee you almost make me feel like a heel  coming between you
well bruce here you are  certified and everything
well shell know some day
dont want to forget this you know might start to rain again
well anyway i know hildys getting a good man
well i got to get back you can find your way out cant you

ill see shes there bruce i promise you
i know how you feel bruce but youve got to forgive her shes only a woman after all
ts ts ts
ill find her bruce if i have to put every detective in the city on the job tell you what  go over to the missing persons bureau and describe your mother what does she look like
oh bruce let me see that money hildy gave you
theres a lot of counterfeit big bills going around
oh this is all right bruce i just wanted to be sure
who do you think you are breaking in here like this
if youve any accusations to make hartman make them in the proper manner otherwise ill have to ask you to get out
get out
i can explain that hartman when hildy told me she wanted to interview earl williams i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself
youre barking up the wrong tree hartman
no well   johnson youre under arrest  you too burns
ill show you what im doing burns youre guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post im going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this
hartman if you take this desk out of this building ill put you behind bars
im warning you  itll be a federal offense  and youll be an accessory
what about this burns kidnapping eh
call duffy
youre going to be in office for exactly two days more and then were pulling your nose out of the feed bag
whats this
does it you forget the power that always watches over the morning post
duffy get liebowitz
this is the morning post youre talking to
thats absurd on the face of it mr burns hes talking like a child
save that for the tribune
what do you want
hello hildy
how long is what
lets see i was in reno six weeks  then bermuda oh about four months i guess seems like yesterday to me
no  mama doesnt dream about you any more walter you wouldnt know the old girl now
youre repeating yourself thats the speech you made the night you proposed   any time  any place  anywhere
ill always remember it if i hadnt remembered it i wouldnt have divorced you
done what
holy mackerel look walter thats what divorces are for
i suppose thats true in a way i am fond of you walter i often wish you werent such a stinker
well why did you promise me you wouldnt fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works
a fellow your age hiring an airplane to write  hildy dont be hasty  remember my dimple walter it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it
was it my fault did i know that coal mine was going to have another cavein i meant to be with you on our honeymoon hildy  honest i did
deny it im proud of it we beat the whole country on that story
lets not fight hildy tell you what you come back to work on the paper and if we find we cant get along in a friendly way well get married again
i havent any hard feelings
sure come on well have some lunch and you can tell me everything
you can break it cant you
sure you can come on
what do you mean by that
you mean youre not coming back to work here
youve had a better offer eh
well go on and take it work for somebody else thats the gratitude i get for 
what were you when you came here five years ago a little college girl from a school of journalism i took a little dollfaced mugg 
why should i i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering
i made a great reporter out of you hildy but you wont be half as good on any other paper and you know it you need me and i need you  and the paper needs both of us
it would have worked if youd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter but no you had to marry me and spoil everything
well you practically did making googoo eyes at me for two years till i broke down and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed if youd been a gentleman youd have forgotten all about it but not you
sweeney you cant do that to me not today of all days jumping jehosophat oh no sweeney well i suppose so all right if you have to you have to  how do you like that everything happens to me  with 365 days in the year  this has to be the day
sweeney
not yet might just as well be the only man on the paper who can write  and his wife picks this morning to have a baby
i dont care whether he did or not hes supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is  waiting at the hospital is there no sense of honor left in this country
theres nobody else on the paper who can write thisll break me unless   hildy
youve got to help me hildy
itll bring us together again hildy  just the way we used to be
dont mock hildy this is bigger than anything thats happened to us dont do it for me do it for the paper
if you wont do it for love how about money forget the other offer and ill raise you twentyfive bucks a week
all right  thirtyfive and not a cent more
great grief whats that other paper going to give you
oh in that case the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it trying to blackjack 
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing im getting married walter and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get im through
you cant sell me that walter
thats why im quitting i want to go some place where i can be a woman
a journalist peeking through keyholes  running after fire engines  waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitlers going to start a war  stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen i know all about reporters  a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets and for what so a million hired girls and motormens wives will know whats going on no walter im through
bermuda
not what youd call rich makes about five thousand a year
hes in the insurance business
its a good honest business isnt it
well i can and i love it he forgets the office when hes with me he doesnt treat me like an errandboy  he treats me like a woman
i dont know about water buffaloes but i know about him hes kind and sweet and considerate he wants a home  and children
well ill give you a hint by tomorrow theyll be calling me mrs bruce baldwin
the quicker the better well  i finally got out what i came in to tell you  so long walter and better luck next time
thanks
well hes waiting in the anteroom for me now
oh better not walter wouldnt do any good
afraid i should say not
then what does he want with you
you wouldnt believe this walter but bruce holds the door open for me
and he takes his hat off when hes with a lady
and when he walks with a lady he waits for her
allow me
i suppose i cant call this off without creating a scene  but remember its your last fling
well ill tell you one thing old man she never looked at me the way shes looking at you
heres luck to the bride and bridegroom
what now
you said it
if hes nuts why doesnt the state just put him away
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town
no bruce dear dont you see this is a trick to get your sympathy no walter ive been waiting for something like this  but i wasnt sure when youd spring it if you want to save earl williams life you can interview him yourself youre still a good reporter bruce and i will be on that four oclock train  and thanks just the same
why walter youre getting poetic
how can you have any happiness after that all through the years youll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours i tell you earl williams face will come between you on the train tonight  and at the preachers tomorrow  and all the rest of your lives
what do you mean only an act havent you got any feeling
what do you mean
all right hildy im licked but ill make you and bruce a business proposition
now youre talking
what tricks would i pull
what do you think i am  a crook
all right the check will be certified want my fingerprints
exclusive thats great
never mind that whats the story
youll get it now whats the story  ill have the paper send the money right down to you i swear it on my mothers grave
i meant on my grandmothers grave dont be so technical hildy whats the story
well im coming to it it seems the professor had to have a gun to re enact the crime with  and who do you suppose supplied it nobody else but that great thinker sheriff hartman
no this is on the level walter im not good enough to make this one up the sheriff gave his gun to the professor the professor gave it to earl and earl gave it right back to the professor  right in the stomach who no egelhoffer wasnt hurt badly they took him to the county hospital where theyre afraid hell recover
it better be fifteen minutes because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meters clicking away to beat the band
walter ddid you see    that
she jumped out of the window
where do you think youre going
get bruce out of jail how can you worry about a man whos resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on hildy this is war you cant desert now
you drooling idiot what do you mean youre getting out there are three hundred and sixtyfive days in the year one can get married  but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk  once in a lifetime hildy youve got the whole city by the seat of the pants
you know youve got the brain of a pancake that wasnt just a story you covered  it was a revolution hildy this is the greatest yarn in journalism since livingstone discovered stanley for the new york herald 
dont get technical at a time like this do you realize what youve done youve taken a city thats been graftridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn youre kicking em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new yorks having under la guardia well make such monkeys out of these wardheelers next tuesday that nobodyll vote for them  not even their wives
well think it then because its true well crucify that mob were going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive then well let the governor in on the capture  share the glory with him
youve kicked over the whole city hall like an applecart youve got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall youve put one administration out and another in this isnt a newspaper story  its a career and you stand there bellyaching about whether you catch an eight oclock train or a nine oclock train still a dollfaced mugg thats all you are
attagirl why theyll be naming streets after you  hildy johnson street therell be statues of you in the parks hildy the radioll be after you  the movies  by tomorrow morning ill betcha theres a hildy johnson cigar i can see the billboards now light up with hildy johnson

what do you mean brucell be waiting for you in albany
whered you wire him

both jobs are open hildy the paper  and being mrs walter burns
sure it was good  it was wonderful only you expected it to be like other marriages it cant be like other marriages  were different were a different world look at what we went through today i wouldnt trade that for any honeymoon in the world i bet you wouldnt either
thats what makes it romantic every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is and vice versa but us  you never know where i am and im not sure where you are thats romance
hildy if thats what you want all right well even go to  how about niagara falls
sure i do and ill tell you something else  id like a baby
sure i cant last forever i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper
well if she looked like you  say my brains and your looks  that mightnt be such a bad combination
whats the good of arguing about something that probably doesnt exist look hildy im proposing to you what do you say
what
thats what he said the last time dont believe him judge
how about bruces
hildy darling
itll be heaven
but hildy  i can explain 
louie take this lady over to polack mikes and lock her up see that she doesnt take to anyone on the way
are you referring to me madam
come on sheriff weve got to get bail
oh dear oh dear
down western avenue we were going sixtyfive miles an hour you know what i mean
butterfingers i give you an old lady to take somewhere and you hand her over to the cops

you stay here ill find out everything
anything you want boss
who do you want
you know me the shirt off my back
sure boss
walter
well youre not too busy to know that the governor hasnt signed that reprieve
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us
hes on my phone he just called me
dont blame me im city editor in name only you do all the hiring around here
heres that certified check walter  i drew out my wifes savings and if this isnt back by 530 im a ruined man
hello hildy what are you doing around here
say isnt this your twenty dollars
cooley i want to talk to you
theres money in it cooley
how much
lets see the money
the newspapers sheriff theyre the scum of modern civilization
theyre always after me for interviews
of course i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here you dont mind
well have to satisfy them what would you say to giving them a joint interview i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects
yes shaking hands i dont take a very good picture though
i dont know 
are you gentlemen all through with me
you know you are to be executed mr williams who do you feel is responsible for that
i see you realize however that you committed a crime
now the sheriff will be mollie malloy in whose room you were you will be earl williams and i will be the policeman follow me mr williams
so  now i say to you earl williams you are under arrest and you point your gun at me
well that about covers everything
say thats old prissy bensingers desk
i call what you got
who locked the door
open up there will you
hey
kind of exclusive aint you we got calls to make you know
mollie malloy  what happened to her
she looks as though shes going to come to
a fine bunch of reporters biggest story in two years and theyre too lazy to go after it
better let us in on it mollie
that must be the tenth alienist theyve had on williams even if he wasnt crazy before he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him  gimme the desk
yeah what did he ever do for his country
trouble is when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf
well a guy can win when hildy aint around
she says shes gonna write fiction
you guys wanna play some more poker
boy did you see her go
no i tell you nobody knows where he got it
so have we
say hildy if i know you you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us are you trying to scoop us or something
oh you two are pals now  i think youre right endicott mollie did give her some kind of story
come on you before we slap you down

gus this 
same way you did  through that gate
all right then ill just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner of course with election coming that might do you a lot of harm but just as you say
oh nothing much just that the state had proved he was sane  and he admits it himself if you dont want me to run it 
no thanks sheriff im leaving town tonight
just a minute johnson
take your paws off me
let me go  fellows somethings happened to my motherinlaw
i dont know anything i tell you theres been an accident
you can send somebody with me if you dont believe me
johnson im going to the bottom of this what do you know about williams are you going to talk or arent you
whered you get this
he went over to the hospital to call on professor egelhoffer
hes harmless
thats murder
if the mayor wants me he knows where i am
what went off

pete youre through
i mean im scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place its nothing personal and pete  its the only way out its a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
now pete please dont appeal to my sentimental side
i wish you wouldnt talk like that pete
that gives you an idea of what im up against
williams aint a red and you know it
i know it but theyve got nothing to do with this case do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams were going to lose em
the governor gave me his word of honor he wouldnt interfere two days ago
pure politics
dementia praecox ohhh
tell em the party is through in this state on account of you
and you can tell em as an afterthought that i want your resignation now
what is it
tell em to hold the wire
no  dont out me off
hold your horses  will you olsen hurry up fred
well fix that too 
all right tell em to shoot to kill
shoot to kill i said
nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered now do as i tell you
now take that guilty look off your face pete  and stop trembling like a horse
fine work pete you certainly delivered the goods im proud of you
a sight for sore eyes
who is this man
you drunken idiot arrest him the idea of coming here with a cockand bull story like that
thats a lie
take those handcuffs off our friends pete that wasnt at all necessary
walter i cant tell you how badly i feel about this there was no excuse for hartwell to fly off the handle
and so do i
fine thanks sheriff
i wont
i hope youre pretty nearly through with me doctor im getting a little fatigued
got you williams

gentlemen of the press always picking on somebody who cant defend himself  the littler the better

hildy i thought you were gone 
hiding him where
mother
mother i can explain everything ill go with you in five minutes and 
i dont know what shes talking about i never said any such thing
mother
i couldnt plead insanity because you see im just as sane as anybody else
of course not i couldnt kill anybody  its against everything ive ever stood for they know it was an accident theyre not hanging me for that  theyre hanging me for my beliefs
theyre very simple i believe in the golden rule im not the first man to die for preaching it but if they would only listen to it  we could have a fine decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things
id do away with the profit system and have production for use only theres enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if wed use some sense
its the only answer everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose we could solve all our problems food was meant to be eaten not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved clothing was meant to be worn not piled up in stores while people went naked doesnt that make sense
a gun  why  to shoot of course
sure you see id never had a gun in my hand before and i didnt know what to do with it well when i get stuck i know that theres an answer for everything in production for use so it came to me in a flash whats a gun for to shoot so i shot simple isnt it
theres nothing crazy about that is there
miss mollie malloy shes a wonderful person
dont forget about production for use
youre not going to phone anybody where i am
youre not going to shoot me earl im your friend remember ive got to write that story about your production for use
earl you dont want to hurt your friends do you
maybe youre my friend and maybe youre not  but dont come any nearer you cant trust anybody in this crazy world say ill bet i could shoot you from here
earl theres just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview
i dont blame you earl  if i were in your place i wouldnt trust anybody either
earl you must never do that again
dont talk too loud
quiet mollie quiet
howd you get here earl
stop screaming mollie or were sunk im trying to think of something before those reporters get back
what goodll it do

where are they gone you know where they are
they got him surrounded some place  gonna shoot him like a dog
whats that
theyll get him theyll get him
im coming  keep dead quiet dont even breathe

well well  miss mollie malloy
look out
sure mollie you never looked better in your life
get the cops somebody

whats your hurry
williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered 
well  williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan hes got to save the world only he makes his speeches usually on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it well the cops let him alone as much as they can because hes harmless and theyre kinda sorry for him but one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a veterans parade and the cops chase him he gets scared and goes into hiding  come in dave schwartz

ive been seeing johannsen in chemistry
thats not how he tells it
hunh
you were wonderful
so weve got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements my wonderful men
lila
a penny for your thoughts mon cheri
yes please somebody ask him what is wrong
i want our boy back
that bitch i worked so hard we worked so hard you and i he wouldve made us famous
i know and thats great but it would be great in a better way not a better way but a different way if i could find him and bring him back
i have some thoughts i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape
im going alone this could be dangerous
a little resistance would be nice damn it
no
my apologies madam

very well
were going back to nature you and i im going to retrain you im going to make you free again if i have to kill you doing it
you what
nice night
youll thank me eventually puff well you wont thank me because we wont be speaking but youll sort of thank me with a special look the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you
hes dead
no this is the end of the road theres a dead human being here for all of his faults he was a human being and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody
puff what happened to you is as much my fault as nathans maybe more so because i knew it was wrong and i went along with it anyway im taking responsibility for the murder i want you to go back to your old life
no go back to the woods this is a sacrifice i need to make in my world we have something called penance its another abstraction but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent it doesnt exist for you and it shouldnt see i could never be free again anyway so i might as well be in jail
thats what im counting on
progress
oh yes honey getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over smooth as a babys butt
you still in the market for a real boy
cause theres this guy my brother knows him might be right up your alley
i dont get that is that sexual
handsome thirties psychologist
loves animals loves you
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine mr handsome animal loving psychologist said he would love to meet you
my brother is discreet
my brother says the guys a thirty five year old virgin so maybe he wont know how women usually feel plus hes got bad eyesight almost legally blind which is helpful in this situation plus hes got an extremely small penis of which he is mortifyingly ashamed so chances are hell be so grateful for any non judgmental attention that hell be yours forever
so
my brother says he likes you too
my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan
yeah
dont throw that away i had that once with a guy but i threw it away for a cheap thrill
no i married a midget
well he wasnt really a midget he was on the cusp of midgethood thats what made it cheap had he been an actual midget there wouldve been nothing cheap about it my dear
let me tell you honey midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship theyre portable theyre controllable theyre eager and theyre exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor
oh
be still my crotch
yeah my brother told me
no maid service for gods sake cant you read the fucking do not disturb sign on the fucking doorknob
go the fuck away rosie
rose please go away
howd you know where i was
your brother should have his license revoked
i dont know honey i dont know maybe he just didnt want to get involved
done
uh tie them up rosie if you will
im going to miss you
and im going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me
i like you so much with or without hair  but dont spread that around bad for business
ill be in touch
meditations on a banana slug was a delightful read
as do i
they dont seem to be especially ego driven this is true
i have to say that im not there yet
slugdom sluggishness whatever youd call it im not there yet i still have many human characteristics
yes i suppose not but still one would like to move along to move beyond
i love that you said that it makes me feel a bit lighter ive been rather heavy lately thinking about my childhood realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing  ive been seeing someone a therapist
no no im a psychologist but i do research im a behaviorist i work with animals mice at the moment
heavens no my work now is right now im teaching mice well table manners to be candid
quite well really its a lot of work a lot of reinforcement mostly positive right now ive gotten two of my subjects to use napkins tiny napkins of course
i hope you dont think me daft its important work its part of a larger sociological experiment im federally funded
its my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice they can be taught to humans
the truth is most people dont have table manners today and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels
courtesy decorum manners are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse rudeness vulgarity meanness are the norm
it looks wonderful
ummmm oh nathan this salad is delish
im sorry
oh im sorry  im sorry nathan i never really learned those things
boy this is good
no im sorry im really backward in certain areas
you do
you really enjoy my company
its just that i have some peculiarities and
you do
actually mother and father you look very very old you look terrible
what are you doing in there
im sorry about my parents
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light you know that i feel similarly to you about nature
do you oh do you darling
oh darling im so relieved lets celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow
itll be wonderful ill show you my old stomping grounds
shaving cream
darling did you bring the insect repellent lotion
oh and the sun block
what spf sweetie
perfectomundo we are ready  say wouldnt it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block think of all the time one would save
i think ill get johannsen in chemistry on that  oh did you bring the first aid kit
flares
we could call it quit bugging me sunny  get it sunny sunny
did you see that
i dont know something
no too upright mightve been a person
come on
youll catch cold its cold  what do you suppose he is a survivalist
feral dont touch him he might be diseased he might my god rabies
i think we should go please before he wakes up and i dont know eats us or whatever feral things do
actually i just had an amusing thought
feral huh totally uncontaminated
its perfect
forget mice actually forget guinea pigs cats monkeys and chimps also im on to stage five the human subject
dont you see hes my tabula rasa my eliza dolittle hes my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain hes going to make me famous
is he lila is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness never to know the love of a good woman never to revel in the pitterpatter of little feet never to read moby dick or marvel at a monet or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work smoke a pipe and wonder about the nature of reality
what is it that makes us human if not the knowledge that we are indeed human think of this poor souls education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon
what are you doing in there
who is it
who is it
who from work
its hormonal nathan i cant help it im sorry
im getting electrolysis its working but it takes time so meanwhile i have to
apes dont shave you son of a bitch
im sorry please dont be mad at me for this
im the same person i was before you knew damn it oh god
was that okay i mean was i able to satisfy you
really wow thats thats terrific to hear from someone so feminine so female
so hows it going today
everythings fine honey we dont need to talk besides i have to work late
are you seeing somebody else nathan i just have to know
it would just be helpful to know
because you know you seem so distant and you work late every night and we hardly ever have sex and when we do its i dont know it feels different
do you like my new look
im trying you know  im trying to be what you want i want to be what you want nathan all i want is to be what you want
really
because im really trying you know rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis
thats great its a great color for you
oh  i didnt see you there sneaky boy  youre like a boy sneaking in
you remember that from my book im touched  whats wrong
hows work
no i dont want your work to be cruddy
oh baby im sorry cant you hire somebody else
hey i could come work for you i know i havent been all that supportive of this project but ive come around
oh yes baby i think that this is a wonderful project youre doing taking this poor unfortunate uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being what a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are
yes and i want to help you wont have to pay me and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway
who needs it i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things i love being a woman because
such as my man and how to please him  such as making wonderful dinners for my man  such as looking pretty for my man  and im writing an article on quilting for the ladies home journal
bravo to you puff
i think hes ready
you just have to control it were not apes
puff im proud of you you did remarkably well under difficult circumstances
im going to go down and check on puff see how hes holding up
nah you just relax hows the book
you were gone a long time
so hes doing okay
thats funny because you know i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside he called here when he ran out of his mad money after spending an entire evening drinking watching strippers and fucking a whore  oh and what did you do tonight honey
and what did you do tonight honey
and what did you do tonight honey
do you know what i gave up to be with you
i gave up my soul my beliefs i gave up my body hair
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart
shut up yeah this is lila cunt and dont let the hirsutism fool you i know more about being a woman and more about the black hearts of men than you in your pretty little powdered bullshit fantasy world can ever imagine i know the darkness and cruelty of nature sweetie pie
aha finally ive covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern ohio
look at you two you both disgust me
shut up  i gave you life i created you in my image puff i took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners and this is how you repay me by heading back to the ooze first chance you get i should leave you here with lila the ape woman it would serve you right you ungrateful piece of crap but im not going to youre too valuable to me totally selfish of me you serve my purpose but if you had any smarts you would realize that i serve your purpose as well life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit
goodeveninglaydeesandgent elmen
oh boy
this is great puff youre doing fine
i dont think this aversion therapy is really necessary doctor i understand the problem
i bow to your expertise in these matters
excellent work puff extra desert tonight

interesting
ugnh
unn
puff put the gun down
lets be reasonable human beings here were all reasonable human beings arent we
look why dont you and lila stay here and have your natural life ill just go on my way youll never see me again
you did create me in your image nathan before you i was a simple happy complete being in harmony with the world around me after you i became duplicitous cynical angry anal totally out of touch with my surroundings in a word nathan i became you lila has reintroduced me to myself and incidentally what im about to do kill you is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth before when i killed it was for food or in selfdefense now i will kill for revenge revenge is an abstract concept nathan and i learned abstract thinking from you
so anyway thats the nightmare ive been having lately
no why
oh i see yes thats something to think about thats very good thats what you get the big bucks right ha ha
i love lila i mean shes a wonderful person and she loves me thats no small potatoes i mean she really loves me shes sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me and shes a good person a truly good person how rare is that in this world eh and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection if it can even be called that i mean god knows im not perfect what about my eyesight its lousy thats what lilas not going to leave me because of my eyesight what about my penis

you bastard
ill make it up to you
are you ready for another

i dont think theres a pool player alive shoots better pool than i saw you shoot the other night at ames you got talent
character
youre damned right im sure everybodys got talent i got talent you think you can play bigmoney straight pool or poker for forty straight hours on nothing but talent you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just cause hes got talent nah minnesota fatss got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body
he drank as much whisky as you did
you bet he knows how  you think thats a talent too huh knowin how to drink whisky you think minnesota fats was born knowin how to drink
thats your problem
maybe by that time youll die of old age how much do you think youll uh need
no three thousand at least hell start you off at five hundred a game  hell beat the pants off you thats the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is hell beat you flat four or five games  maybe more depending on how uh steady your nerves are but he might  he just might be a little scared of you and that could change things but i wouldnt count on it

eddie is it all right if i get personal
eddie youre a born loser
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked really hooked but you let him off
sure you got drunk thats the best excuse in the world for losing no trouble losing when you got a good excuse and winning that can be heavy on your back too like a monkey you drop that load too when you got an excuse all you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself its one of the best indoor sports feeling sorry for yourself  a sport enjoyed by all especially the born losers

what the hell is the point of having a beeper if you dont turn it on
what the hell is this
did you try to switch to transponder channels
lets retrofit the dish to another satellite
theres good news and bad news
youre in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch
no the good news is i found the problem and its not our equipment theres some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed
yes because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas we should be able to block out the overlay completely
ive got a lock on the signal pattern we can filter it out
strange thing is if my calculations are right itll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway the signal reduces itself every time it recycles eventually it will disappear are you listening
whatre you talking about
tell her to get the kids and leave town
okay why did i just send my family to atlanta
not really
a countdown to what
then what
what are you waiting my social security will expire youll still be sitting there
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose

marcus  i did it
you know how long ive been looking for that
all my life
your treat
what has the old fool got himself into now
dad
venice italy
its dads grail diary every clue he ever followed every discovery he made a complete record of his search for the holy grail this is his whole life why would he have sent this to me
do you believe the grail actually exists
but if you want facts indy i have none to give you at my age im prepared to take a few things on faith
ah venice
that doesnt look much like a library
marcus  ive seen this window before
look indy the roman numerals
hows the head
the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins marcus  you remember what the grail tablet said across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon  but where exactly
now he knew there was a city with an oasis due east here he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river and the river led into the mountains here straight to the canyon he knew everything except where to begin the name of the city
yes now we know
what about you
indy indy you must hurry come quickly
marcus
henry what are you doing here
henry the pen 
look what you did
the word of god
indy henry follow met i know the way  haaa
tell me whats going to happen when we get to venice
schneider
care to wet your whistle marcus
well marcus we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind
are you expected
tapestries
this is a castle and we have many tapestries but if youre a scottish lord then i am mickey mouse
my name is donovan walter donovan
well its sandstone christian symbol early latin text midtwelfth century i should think
where did this come from
where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever
the arthur legend ive heard this bedtime story before
an old mans dream
hard to resist isnt it the holy grails final resting place described in detail
let me tell you another bedtime story doctor jones after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade three brothers to be exact
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knights story it doesnt reveal on location of the grail im afraid but the knight promised that two markers that had been left behind would  this tablet is one of those markers it proves the knights story is true but as you pointed out  its incomplete  now the second marker is entombed with the knights dead brother our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice italy  as you can now see doctor jones were about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago were only one step away
you could be more right than you know
weve hit a snag our project leader has vanished along with all his research uh we received a cable from his colleague doctor schneider who has no idea of his whereabouts or whats become of him  i want you to pick up the trail where he left off find the man and you will find the grail
donovan
impossible what do you say jones ready to go down in history
nazis  is that the limit of your vision the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world well theyre welcome but i want the grail itself the cup that gives everlasting life hitler can have the world but he cant take it with him im going to be drinking my own health when hes gone the way of the dodo  the grail is mine and youre going to get it for me
im through
doctor jones
and my mothers ears but the rest belongs to you
the last time i saw your father we were in the library he was very close to tracking down the knights tomb ive never seen him so excited he was as giddy as a schoolboy
fraulein  will you permit me
i usually dont either
it would make me very happy
my dad sent me this diary for a reason until we find out why i suggest we keep it to ourselves
bingo
except hes lost and im not
pagan symbols fourth or fifth century
the ark of the covenant
it must be one of these
whats that
wouldnt it be wonderful if he were here now to see this
dont wander off
i said go around
my room
this
uhhuh
at least i let you tag along
knock it off youre not mad
no you like the way i do things
what do you know about this place
what are you going to do
this one i think hes in here
this book contained a map  a map with no names  precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon
how did you get here
you came back for the book why
is that what you think of me i believe in the grail not the swastika
all i have to do is squeeze
i never expected to see you again
elsa elsa dont move
elsa elsa dont elsa elsa give me your other hand honey i cant hold you
dad
its important
no dad you listen to me 
it is you junior
but what are you doing here
oh it breaks the heart
ill never forgive myself 
no dad get your stuff weve got to get out of here
dad they come in through the doors
humpf  so i was wrong this time but by god i wasnt wrong when i mailed you my diary you obviously got it
through the library
found it
well what was left of him
alexandretta  its a great moment in henrys life he turns aside lost to himself for a moment then turns to indy with joy
you did it
if only i could have been with you
rats
they want my diary
you didnt did you  you didnt bring it did you
you did
i should have mailed it to the marx brothers
take it easy why do you think i sent it home in the first place  so it wouldnt fall into their hands
no dont shoot
she ransacked her own room and i fell for it how did you know she was a nazi
how did you she was a nazi
ooooh i like the austrian way better
lets try and get these ropes loose weve got to get to marcus before the nazis do
what am i looking for
feels like a cigarette lighter
i ought to tell you something
the floors on fire see
and the chair
dad
dad
what
this is intolerable
dad
come on dad come on
stop
youre going the wrong way we have to get to berlin
my diarys in berlin
there is more in the diary than just the map
well he who finds the grail must face the final challenge
three devices of such lethal cunning
oh yes but i found the clues that will safely take us through in the chronicles of st anselm
i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldnt have to remember
yes the only thing that matters is the grail
marcus would agree with me
thats for blasphemy the quest for the grail is not archaeology its a race against evil if it is captured by the nazis the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth do you understand me
what did you get
when were airborne with germany behind us then ill share that sentiment
you know sharing your adventures is an interesting experience
well im as human as the next man
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink i had a milk shake
we didnt talk we never talked
a regret it was just the two of us dad it was a lonely way to grow up for you too if you had been an ordinary average father like the other guys dads youd have understood that
did i ever tell you to eat up go to bed wash your ears do your homework no i respected your privacy and i taught you selfreliance
you left just when you were becoming interesting
well i cant think of anything
what does that mean
i didnt know you could fly a plane
dad  eleven oclock
dad are we hit
nice landing
those people are trying to kill us
its a new experience for me
this is intolerable
what do you think youre doing get down
now who are all these people
dad
dad
only the penitent man will pass only the penitent man will pass
the penitent man is humble before god
but in the latin alphabet jehovah begins with an i
junior give me your other hand i cant hold on
elsa never really believed in the grail she thought shed found a prize
what did you find junior
i like indiana
ready
uhhuh
i knew youd come but my strength has left me
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it
youre strangely dressed for a knight
get that camel out of the way
that car belonged to my brotherin law
im going after those horses
i dont need camels
sallah i said no camels thats five camels cant you count
wheres my father
why are you trying to kill us
my father was looking for the holy grail did you kill him too
where is he talk  or youre dead damn it tell me tell me
then well die
this is your last chance
all right wheres my father
who are you
and why were you trying to kill me
ask yourself why do you seek the cup of christ is it for his glory or for yours
captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the natives
dr jones you know very well that the thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century
well mr prime minister my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in pankot
interested in local curios
charming
thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing
youre hanging on better here than you did in america
the prime minister doesnt seem that naive
im sure its nothing just rumors  what was it they claimed was stolen
rather bizarre menu wouldnt you say
ive spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels  i shouldnt have let somebody like willie go in there with me
then she must have run out of the room and you found her
i believe were being called to dinner
jones isnt in his room miss scott  my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi 
what
who
hard to believe isnt it
the plane crash and your journey here sound  most incredible
hes not exactly what we call a spring chicken
they will escort you to your rooms now you will be provided with fresh clothes tonight you will be dining with his highness
listen mr lal what do you call the maharajahs wife
miss scott youre not making any sense
i sense the fumes of opium in all this perhaps miss scott picked up the habit in shanghai
i would say you look rather lost  but then i cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home
wed appreciate it if the maharajah would let us stay tonight well be on out way in the morning
i had a question mr prime minister i was examining some of the maharajahs artifacts
i suppose stories of the thuggees die hard
their stories are just fear and folklore
you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them
there you see captain a rock
i was dubious myself at first then something connected  the villages rock and the old legend of the sankara stones
the newspapers exaggerated the incident
that was a misunderstanding
mola ram is telling the faithful of out victory he says the british have left the palace which proves kali mas new power
you understand what he tells us
dr jones
you never told me you spoke my language dr jones
so it is true dr jones you found nurhachi
you have insulted my son
whats that
now what about the antidote lao
wow holy smoke crash landing
you got the tickets short round
indy
indy they make our plane crash to get you here
i ride with you indy
indy look
what you look at indy
that little maharajah think he big stuff
next time i flatten him did you see his eyes
he was afraid of you he knows a tough guy when he sees one
get to sleep indy  i stay up and keep eye on things
what does it mean indy
the village knew their rock was magic  but they didnt know it was one of the lost sankara stones
this is nainsukh  from the village they bring him here to dig in the mines
come one whats wrong
slow on the curves or well fly off the tracks
let up on the brake
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones
there were five stones in the beginning over the centuries they were dispersed by wars sold off by thieves like you
no they are here  somewhere a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs
they dig for the gems to support our cause they also search for the last two stones soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful
thats far enough
give me the stones
no the stones are mine
on the way to delhi you will stop at pankot
you will go to palace there
it is pankot palace that kills my village
the evil starts in pankot then like monsoon it moves darkness over all country
it is why krishna brought you here
was the stone very smooth  it was probably brought here from a sacred river
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone
you will find them when you find sivlalinga
i like the service here
look out damn it i need that antidote
for crying out loud a kids driving the car
listen we just met for crissake im not that kind of girl
you dont look very good
whatre we going to do wherere we going
ill take the extra ticket  wheres this plane going anyway

shortys family was killed when they bombed shanghai he was living on the streets
by the way howd you end up in shanghai
what about the future
id like to find one of those myself
yeah but hes got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years  fortune and glory
the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago
its sanskrit it tells the story of sankara climbing mt kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva
legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers
i think you should sleep closer  i meant for safety
couldnt keep away huh
hes afraid of something
any more complaints
ive always had a weakness for folk dancing
thats the maharajah  that kid
cheer up you lost your prince but dinners on the way

well give you a heads up before we launch
three hours
well are you or are you not charlie
we gotta hook up
pjs
whens your deadline
push it
its a smear campaign charlie
oh its real selective about as hard to get a hold of as the manhattan phone book
and its bullshit and if im right are you going to put the journals reputation behind a story thats going to blow up in your face
are you all right
these are their leads their sources i want you to have your reporters
i want you to get legal onto corporate confidentiality agreements boundaries of their constraint kentucky state law about i want you to drop everything
what does that do
what i mean is like how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement
shit
i dont know what he was thinking
alright alright
whens the air date
what was that about
sure
i cant get out of here til mid morning ill be in tomorrow night  listen could you call a number for me its in mississippi
yeah yeah sure ill see if i can find him hold on  yeah dons looking for you
can i go to dance tomorrow im better
do you want more rice
what are you cooking
i heard wigands deposition got sealed
tortious interference sounds like a disease caught by a radio
since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on 60 minutes
yeah i heard rumors
are you suggesting that she and eric are influenced by money
cbs does not do that and youre questioning our journalistic integrity
youre exaggerating
you are a fanatic an anarchist you know that if we cant have a whole show then i want half a show rather than no show but oh no not you you wont be satisfied unless youre putting the company at risk
so what are you going to do
youre taking no for an answer
im staying right here doing my job fighting to get my show on the air you dont like it hey ill tell you what fire my ass
what the hell are you doing
no not that im talking about the associated press they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i did you tell them that we were lying
the new york times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors you fucked us
there has been so much soul searching about this wigand ive decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview
thats happening and hopefully we wont have to use the alternate but we should have it in the can
im afraid you are
so now if youll excuse me gentlemen mr rathers been complaining about his chair again  as they start to leave
and what are you implying
did you handle the round mr wigand
a gun yes
what caliber is my gun
you think i put that bullet in the mailbox myself
that bullet was for a 38 caliber do you own a 38
do you have a history of emotional problems mr wigand
you cant take that its personal property
that computer has everything
debbie
oh bill main justice is investigating a major new york bank laundering narco dollars out of their mexico city branch you want it for the evening news
im gonna do a followup
shall i send for coffee sorry im late
if this holds up and it very well may not mike but if it did and we aired this segment and cbs was sued by brown  williamson i think we could be at grave risk
mike mike mike
what does that mean rife with  
no only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him
his veracity was good enough for the state of mississippi
well as a standard ill hang with is the guy telling the truth
come again
is cbs corporate telling cbs news do not go to air with this story
hey lowell
hi baby
how prominent what kind of placement
well until you do all i can tell you is what you already know they will not air an interview
hello
heres how it works you ask me questions i tell you if youre wrong
yeah
why
you ready
lowell
i can take her
is there any more rice
im sorry darling have you seen my coffee mug
uh what are those boxes
what do you need at the store
right now
why did you take your stuff from the office
i dont understand
why who said
theres a severance agreement it includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage  sure you dont need anything
whats going on

whats wrong
what
what are you and mike going to do
jeffrey wigand
im lowell bergman im from 60 minutes you know you take the 60 minutes out of that sentence nobody returns your phone call maybe wigands right maybe im hooked what am i hooked on the rush 60 minutes what the hell for infotainment its so fucking useless all of it
free press press is free for anyone who owns one larry tisch has a free press
i got perspective
from my perspective whats been going on and what ive been doing is ridiculous its halfmeasures
yeah
is it too late
oh my god
yes im right here could you call me back on a hard line
area code 2125550199
you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the state of mississippi did you not
well im working with someone now who was the former head of research at brown  williamson a former corporate officer there
has he decided to go public because let me tell you weve been doing this for three years now and weve worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistleblowers so we know big tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him so is your man truly committed
well wed certainly be interested in making his acquaintance but without knowing what hes going to do
it would be better if he called us
alright
yeah im here
id be lying to you if i did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion
were there
come in earlier on mikes marine barracks line when hes talking to sheikh mussawi
yeah
he referred to this the seven dwarfs
well it isnt cigarettes are bad for you
no shit
okay lets look through the looking glass the other way
we got a guy who wants to talk but hes constrained  what if he were compelled
so is everything okay
thank you for saying that
oh man
it went great in mississippi mike
i think what were trying to tell you is that it happens all the time this is a news organization people are always telling us things they shouldnt we have to verify if its true and in the public interest and if it is we air it
i discovered this sec filing  for the sale of the cbs corporation to westinghouse corporation
lowell
lowell
lowell
ive been banished in lieu of being fired
i dont know how does that get wigand on the air
yeah
i disappeared on you
did i get you up
how many shows have we done huh cmon how many
yeah thats right
i see a rhetorical question on the horizon
oh how fortunate i am to have lowell bergmans moral tutelage to point me down the shining path to show me the way
give me a break
in the real world when you get to where i am there are other considerations
mike in my
that canada story still interest you
cmon it all worked out you came out okay in the end
coffee
how have you liked your stay
please to explain why i should agree to interview with prozionist american media
perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and i see the questions first then i decide if i grant the interview
tell him i will see him day after tomorrow
whos that
how do you like your coffee black
look i really dont have that much time
i know what i have to know
but thats as far as i go
doesnt cbs have confidentiality agreements mr bergman
did work
how much would i get paid
should i just take the documents now
protect your sources you screwed me you sold me out
mrs wigand how do you do
cmere i want to talk to you
what do
this is my house in front of my wife my kids what business do we have
so you didnt mention my name you havent talked to anybody about me
how did brown  williamson know i spoke to you
it happened after i talked to you i do not like coincidences
you came all the way down here to tell me that
and im unemployed so i have to protect my medical coverage  so i left them a message this morning their expanded confidentiality agreement i will sign it
talk to me outside the zone of your agreement
like whered you work before brown  williamson
seven dwarfs
and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction disease
okay so here you are you go to work for tobacco  you come from corporate cultures where research really creative thinking these are core values you go to tobacco tobacco is a sales culture market and sell enormous volume go to a lot of golf tournaments the hell with everything else  what are you doing why are you working for tobacco in the first place
ive always thought of myself as a man of science thats whats wrong with it
the new place new
you know i was thinking of calling you tomorrow anyway  how are your kids handling the new house
no you said you were going to call me tomorrow so what about
okay
howd you know that lowell
hello you there
what did you get us
the internet said you did graduate work in wisconsin then went to uc la jolla with professor marcus
next to your father
is that why you became a journalist then you get to ask all the questions
my father was a mechanical engineer most ingenious man i ever knew
why
i drink a couple of occasions more than i should have  i was cited for shoplifting once but it was a mistake  i pushed liane one time we were both stressed out because of the pressure she went to her mothers  i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself and i dont like to be pushed around
im just a commodity to you arent i i could be anything right anything worth putting on between commercials
you believe that
you should because when youre done a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion my friend and thats the power you have
i believe that yes i believe that
yes
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here i never abandoned a source
no dont evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or 60 minutes with this cheap skepticism
excuse me yeah
jeff call the fbi right away
jeff
good but jeff
liane this is a preliminary  you didnt tell her we were taping what did she think she was coming to new york for
lowell i cant afford 
i called richard scruggs in mississippi
im going to be a witness for them in their litigation so im going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition
you attract a crowd
i heard about the kentucky gag order
whats changed
part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly at least within
i dont know how to say this jeff except to just say it right out so ill say it they do not want to air it
b  w may have threatened litigation cbs is on the block  but you i mean i know how
no no what
oh you know what we do or do not need to know since when have you become a media expert
i told the truth
i was young i was young confused we didnt handle it the right way
yes did you lie about being on the american judo team in the olympics
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview where youre saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics
alright the abc telemarketing company
abc telemarketing company
thats the whole point jeffrey thats the whole point anyones everyones they are gonna look under every rock dig up every flaw every mistake youve ever made they are going to distort and exaggerate everything youve ever done man dont you understand
thats not the point
thats not the fucking point whether you told the truth or not hello
ive got to teach class ive got to go ive got to teach class
you manipulated me into this
you greased the rails
up to you jeffrey thats the power you have jeffrey vital insider information the american public need to know lowell bergman the hot show who never met a source he couldnt turn around
you fought for me  you manipulated me into where i am now staring at the brown  williamson building its all dark except the 10th floor thats the legal department thats where they fuck with my life
where are you anyway
you try and have a good time
i think i need to call the police he wont respond
did he hear you
what about now
whats happening
alright now listen to me i want you  i want you to tell him in these words get on the fucking phone
just give me an example
we have a couple ones hers ones mine everybody uses a different name  modern marriage  hows liane
hold on a minute lowell  somebody may be following me i dont know they came on the property
i dont want to be paranoid i mean maybe its a game some kind of mind game
well no look i mean there was a footprint forget it its probably not important at all  you know i got a job now im teaching high school japanese and chemistry  so what were you calling about
what are you talking about
i heard you but i got to arrange a legal defense first i got to get you to testify in court get it on public record
jeffrey how are you hows the family okay
what do you mean there is no family
and so i moved out i see the girls a couple of days a week
jeff wigand michael moore
mikes our attorney general down here  i was just explaining to jeff they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today
now they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it but the judge threw it out  however for you there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order
you heard mr sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive
all of us did there was this whole line of people whole line of ceos up there all swearing
and thats what cigarettes are for
a delivery device for nicotine put it in your mouth light it up and youre gonna get your fix
youre saying that brown  williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix not by artificially adding nicotine but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia
the straw that broke the camels back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called coumarin when i came on board at bw they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste and had been unsuccessful i wanted it out immediately i was told that it would affect sales so i should mind my own business i constructed a memo to mr sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew we had documentation was similar to coumadin a lungspecific carcinogen
i sent the document forward to sandefur i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute we werent going to remove it as it would impact sales and that that was his decision
most certainly
poor communication skills
i would bet on it
you wish you hadnt blown the whistle
object to the form of the question
object to the form
object
dr wigand i am instructing you  not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the brown  williamson tobacco company and in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the state of kentucky that means you dont talk  mr motley we have rights here
hello
my cocounsel ron motley and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smokingrelated illness  if youd be interested in talking to us wed certainly like to talk to you
jail
jeffs a premiere golfer what are you a two handicap
and he gets out there and he has five strokes on us he has more concentration than anybody ive ever met its spooky how he can concentrate
jeffrey says exactly whats on his mind most people consider what theyre saying social skills jeffrey just charges right ahead  now i know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with brown  williamson jeff
is that a threat
you threatening my family now too
research  you declare as a badge of honor you dont even know what makes water boil
okay  i dont believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements i was paid well for my work the health and welfare benefits are good the severance package is fair i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldnt
yes your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures and yes absent a swimming pool the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious but bonnie who is the real victim here let me suggest the following your husband who on a prior occasion slapped you  beat you

and without it that party is exposed  a sitting duck no wriggle room

marylin what have i done
mrs guttman you have testified that you were your husbands sexual slave for thirtysix years ever since you were married 
prior to your marriage what was your profession
what is your husbands profession
so whod you hire

you like kids
it was like that scene in the godfather frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family and hes in court and he looks into the spectators gallery and sees his brother they brought the brother from sicily and frankie cant say a word he cant testify thats what it was like seeing pat in there i couldnt even have ruth cross examine her
maybe she wanted a free trip to la maybe they offered her money massey is very seductive who knows
i begged you to have a baby
youre vulnerable
you said yes didnt you
is tong older than ming
well he said to make the house mine
it sounded like a bell
 ruth rabinow this is rex rexroth and you must be mrs rexroth

i assume this is on rex
your husband told me you were beautiful but i was unprepared
do you have a hard heart marylin
not yet

hes passionate
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time
no you listen to me  you busted me miles you left me with nothing what did you expect me to do get a degree in counseling write a book about table linen because thats what wives do when they get dumped and frankly im not quite ready for that
the massey prenup has never been pene  successfully challenged
id like to offer my congratulations that was a beautiful gesture of howards
yes hes a diamond in the rough and i have a feeling that someday soon youll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough
i am thrilled for you but tell me this howd you get howard to do it ive addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea
well when this goes south  promise youll have dinner with me
it has bones be sure to swallow one
to victory

apparently she was very disappointed
and here i thought my mother was
were damaged goods
we are miles you know im right theres something off about you and me miles and maybe it isnt because of these women  maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our deficiencies very early on maybe
im sorry miles you shouldnt listen to me im sure you have a very fulfilling life id better go im depressing
friends
i have to say  im speechless no im never speechless
and im not used to  marylin  theres something i want to ask you
i want to be your  your wife

yes yes you do have more experience
you do
no
no maam i have been asleep all my life up to this moment marylin will you marry me
i dont have a ring

honey i could sit
hardly you have six bedrooms
heres my card spend as much as you want we get mileage

exactly and then  maybe  not right away  theres a room right off the bedroom  it would be perfect for a nursery  its a walk in humidor right now  but if i took out the refrigeration unit 
hi
i have a surprise for you
you dont like me
miles i have a very good relationship with all the salesmen i can return everything
miles youre scaring me
well well well look who made bail
i dont know maybe i should grab my mace im a civil attorney i have little experience with the criminal mind
i dont believe you have things
comfy
i want to nail you ass
im reporting you to the irs
im clean with the irs ive reported every dollar ive ever made try again girlfriend
stuff  got a light
arty farty stuff  lithographs and pre castro cubans watches and mileage on private jets stuff miles stuff you get from grateful clients
salary unreported income  by the way what time is it on bellagio road
i dont have to thats what the irs guys do and they do it with great zeal see they work at these tortuous civil service jobs and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies these saps feel well they feel like saps and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath  what is this a romeo and julieta
i know so am i right and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service hes a dedicated underpaid graduate of southwestern university  very tenacious and never more so than when hes dealing with an unscrupulous colleague  i think its only fair to warn you im going to file an action miles and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement
drop the bogus forgery charge and ill forget about your generous friends slash clients
hello
miles miles where have you been ive been trying to get in touch
i will miles i will leave but miles 
just listen to me im sorry miles its true that my initial intention was to
i fell in love miles
its a no go joe
wait he works for you
you were going to have this thug
nonono marylin  im your husband id be entitled to rexs money no matter what happened to you
marylin run ill distract him
hello marylin
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us
but then  i guess  something inside me died when i realized that youd hired a goon to kill me
you wounded me first marylin
youre forgetting howard doyle
income tax evasion
murder
precastro
sweet
rex get away from the door
we are and its winding down
are you forgetting about the atcheson topeka and the santa fe
rex go away i dont want to have to sic the dogs on you
hello rex
are you alright you lost weight
do you need a tagamet
have you been taking your digestive enzymes
im sorry where were we
i was devastated of course
whos that
is this a lover
forgery and fraud
he told me to  he said he wanted me to 
do you think he set me up do you think that was his intention
he never even asked he just assumed 
so now what
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow
shes a legend didnt she do kravis or a pearlman she definitely did a factor
wow
miles massey
do you know him
whos she
maybe
please im not seeing anyone until this is over one husband at a time
i dont know what his game is he dismissed every one of ruths proposals and sarah we werent unreasonable
i dont know ruth kept her cool but i could tell she was surprised
lillys up
every week 
anyway even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence if i didnt know better id swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination
well if he continues to maintain this position  were in court
that stinks they left you with absolutely nothing it makes you wonder about the entire legal system like rodney king
nothing specific but ill have my own place soon
youre not
sarah sorkin ramona barcelona  this is miles massey
but marylin without this youre completely exposed
is this ming
i cant do this anymore lets get some lunch
what
but youre going through with it
so what
well thats about to change big time
soon youll have your own rage
 is not a challenge i need something i can sink my teeth into professionally speaking
wait i know you
youre miles massey you probably dont recognize me the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair
yes i know howard doyle
herb wants to see me
mr massey 
im sorry mr massey but i felt certain youd want to know  marylin rexroth wants to see you
so ruth hows sam
what
so miles if you have a proposal lets hear it
my client has ruled that out
thats delusional
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate
ha ha
 so much for the icebreakers whatre you after ruth
why only fifty percent ruth why not ask for a hundred percent
why not a hundred and fifty percent
are you familiar with kirshner
arty farty
he divorced his wife  he married marylin  he divorced marylin  and he  remarried his wife what kind of sick 
he never ate the prenup did he
did marylin end up with money
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
and its good
dont threaten me miles i did nothing illegal
where does that leave us
mr rexroth
miles massey please sit relax and consider this office your office your haven your war room  for the duration of the campaign
well my wife has me between a rock and a hard place
when i first met marylin  well we were crazy about each other not emotionally of course we just couldnt keep our hands off each other
time marches on ardor cools
ah
gotcha no need to get anatomically correct with me rex
well with the expanding global population  let me ask you this  your wife has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knockout sexy woman you described
not in court you cant has she retained counsel
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves well let me ask you this what kind of settlement do you seek what are for you the parameters of the possible
nothing
so you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear
whats kirshner
i think that went as well as could be expected
and she had private investigators assisting her
in anticipation of making you sick
wait he wants to give her
and she has
wrigley
sometimes i have serious doubts about you
am i mentoring the wrong mentee
what the hell is wrong with you
what do you think
berry spoons
im sorry im late i was having lunch with ruth rabinows assistant guess what marylin rexroth is divorced
and i hear shes richer than croesus
she could buy and sell you ten times over
get me marylin rexroth doyle
she owes me a meal
wrigley
kenneth this is my associate wrigley wrigley this is my friend dr beck
i tried to reach ruth but we couldnt get her
yes  its for your protection sweetheart youre the one with the  the
extinguish
now mrs banderas what is your relationship to mrs rexroth
and how would you define your relationship to mrs rexroth you know  you are her
hi sweetie
no i havent but ive been out of town  hello rex hello there
did you know mrs rexroth was married
let me tell you something about patty
oh thats her name patricia like mine i was pat and she was patty but she changed it after seeing some like it hot to marylin after marylin monroe
divorce was her childhood aspiration
ive been trying to nail georges for years but hes very careful ill just keep having children i think im pregnant by the way
three is not farrow
george was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second
its not so bad these days kids like joint custody two sets of toys
thorstenson gieselensen he just separated from his third hes in fish he is fish
that doesnt make sense its like punishing you for being goal oriented
we cant do the impossible mr andrews
ive put extra men on all along the way
no hes been trailed twentyfour hours a day since this thing started he cant even get a phone call we dont know about
ohmary
how is she
whats the matter anything wrong
yes i know still in the dumps huh
cant you get them to go any faster  this dissolves to a deserted road peter at the wheel of his car his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing
yeah but i dont like the idea of walking in on your jamboree    just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain
mr warne
i was surprised to get your note my daughter hadnt told me anything about you about your helping her
please understand me when i say she didnt tell me anything about it i mean not until a little while ago she thinks youre entitled to anything you can get
dont know id have to see on what you base your claim i presume you feel youre justified in
i sold some drawers and socks too im throwing those in
why not im not charging you for the time i wasted
whats the matter isnt it cheap enough a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars
what ten thousand
who said anything about a reward
all i want is thirtynine sixty if youll give me a check ill get out of this place it gives me the jitters
well go into that some other time
listen did anybody ever make a sucker out of you this is a matter of principle something you probably wouldnt understand  when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i dont like the idea of having to pay for the privilege
here you are  do you mind if i ask you something frankly  do you love my daughter
thats an evasion
if you had half the brains youre supposed to have youd have done it yourselflong ago
a normal human being couldnt live under the same roof with her without going nuts  shes my idea of nothing
whats this about not eating
know what my next move is no more cigarettes
i might
come on ellie stop being silly you know im going to have my way
you ought to know why because

smart arent you so subtle

what do you expect to accomplish by all this im already married
youll never do it you cant do it
whatve you got against king westley
you only met him once 
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something
hes one of the best fliers in the country right now hes planning a trip to japan

a time will come when youll thank me for this
please dont shout

but thats silly child seeing how you feel why
yes i guess i have  i dont want to hurt anybody any more i want to get away from all this front page publicity it suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome i cant walk out on king now itll make us all look so ridiculous  besides what difference does it make  ill never see peter again
peter warne 
oh nono
why no    dont be silly
looks like that was his only interest in me the reward

its a wonder im not panic stricken
thanks nurses governesses chaperones even bodyguards oh its been a lot of fun
it has its moments it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit fathers detectives ii did it once actually went shopping without a bodyguard it was swell i felt absolutely immoral but it didnt last long they caught up with me in a department store i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw guess who was in it
kingking westley was in it
umhm we rode around all afternoon father was frantic by 6 oclock he was having all the rivers dragged 
aw now dont you start telling me i shouldnt dunk
thanks professor
detectives

dont get excited peter they just asked a civil question
well you dont have to lose your temper
oh so now i was drunk
im sorry i didnt take another sock at him
aw nuts youre just like your old man  once a plumber always a plumber there isnt an ounce of brains in your whole family
say you were pretty good jumping in like that got a brain havent you
we could start a twoperson stock company if things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums well call this one the great deception8
after that the three musketeers  id make a great dartagnan
no mushy stuff im running this troupe
i did it was my idea wasnt it
if you dont like it you can resign from the company
i better go over and see her
poor old shapeley you shouldnt have frightened him like that
yes i noticed he was getting a little fat lately  ouch
i was never built for these moonlight strolls  why did we have to leave the bus
first town we hit in the morning you better wire your father
okay with me if you can stand the starvation diet
it takes money to buy food
not a sou i had some before the fainting scene
i didnt give him anything  you were the bighearted gal how about wiring your father now
must be some strange power westley has over you women  how do you expect to get there
yeah
arent you afraid of me
i wish youd stop being playful
this isnt piggyback
youre crazy
and he carried you like this i suppose
your father didnt know beans about piggyback riding
i dont think theres a piggy back rider in your whole family i never knew a rich man yet who was a good piggyback rider
to be a piggybacker it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature
not a one
this looks like the best spot
peter
if youre scared it scares the hunger out of you
all right you win lets forget it
ill get my clothes all wrinkled
what
whats the matter
whats got into you
i wasnt gone more than a minute just went out to find you something to eat
here eat your head off
thought you were hungry
but what
sure
nothing  nothing youd give two cents for
i am i only work when i have to two years ago i got a notion and went to china there was a war going on swell after a while it got stale i went down to tahiti just lay on the beach for six months what could be sweeter
what are you thinking about
really
whatd you say were supposed to be doing
if its just the same to you well sit right here till they come  got a toothpick
there it is better swallow it were not going to have any breakfast
carrots
uhhuh want one
you dont think im going around panhandling for you  best thing in the world for youcarrots had a tough time getting them if that farmer ever caught megoodnight
i wish you wouldnt talk too much we let a car get away 
oh theyll stop all right its a matter of knowing how to hail them
expert going to write a book on it called the hitchhikers hail
you think its simple huh
but the thumb always works different ways to do it though depends on how you feel for instance number one is a short jerky movement  that shows independence you dont care if they stop or not cause you got some money in your pocket see
number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this  that means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmers daughter12
oh thats nothing now take number three for instance thats a pip its the pathetic one when youre brokeand hungryand everything looks black its a long movement like this  with a follow through
here comes a car
something must have gone wrong i guess ill try number two
i guess maybe i wont write that book after all
you dont make me laugh
whatre you going to do
you might give me a little credit
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb
what were you going to do gold dig him for a meal13
eat a carrot
oh peter what happened are you all right
oh youve been hurt theres a cut on
what happened
whatd you give him for the car
you dont have to eat the carrots  just passed a pond with some ducks in it

maybe i could jump out of the window  do you think theyd see me
theres a man here to see you sweetheart
no it isnt im hungry andand scared
comical part of it is it isnt what you want at all in a couple of weeks youll be looking for the nearest exit     people like you spend all your life on a merrygoround i guess thats what makes you so dizzy  youre always chasing after something at least you think you are truth is youre just running away  from yourself mostly cause youre miserable you hate yourself the worlds full of people like you dont know what they want
i just want to be let alone thats all lifes swell if you dont try too hard most people want to get a stranglehold on it theyre not living theyre just feverish  if they didnt get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values theyd find what they want peace and calm when you get right down to it whats all the shootin for will you tell me after all you can only eat three meals a day only sleep in one bed  right now that hay feels pretty good to you doesnt it sure it does cause you were tiredand its the only thing around

oh thanks thanks mister i always knew you guys were kindhearted
boss oswald impersonators  sounds like james bond now
if this is oswald it must be our third oswald
susie watch the language would you please
i dont care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo numa its none of our business  lets keep this side of it quiet shall we
the us attorney in washington declines to serve our subpoena on allen dulles charles cabell cia director richard helms or any fbi agent we named
william walter the night clerk on duty here in the fbi office gave me a copy of this  it went all over the country  nothing was done and the motorcade went ahead on schedule  and this wasnt even mentioned in the warren report  read it al
gentlemen i will not hear this  i value bill as much as anyone here  we all need to make room for someone elses ideas lou especially me maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and im just plain dumb wrong
why you keep dancing on my head for my man  we been thickern molasses pie since law school
there you go  grain of salt  two sides to every coin
right
yeah she was pretty all right but not half as cute as you deano  you shoulda tried a legitimate line of business
when did you first do business with this bertrand
street cats
what was his voice like
did he pay
and oswald
so you saw oswald how many times
recall any names
did you speak to oswald in dallas
then how the hell did you get in the warren commission dean  except through the phone records in the dallas jail
of course there werent cause they disappeared  and yet the commission found you dean
all this blubbering over that sonofabitch  theyre grieving like they knew the man  it makes me want to puke
a bullshit president  i dont see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedys communist buddies  all these damned peace treaties im telling ya jack thats what happens when you let the niggers vote  they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart
well the kid musta gone nuts right  i said oswald mustve flipped  just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him right
whod ever thought that goofy oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination  just goes to show you can never know about some people  am i right jack  well bless my soul  your eyes are as red as two cherries jack  dont tell me we have another bleeding heart here  hell all these years i thought you were on my side
who the hell opened my files  youve been looking through my private files havent you you weasel
you found out about dave ferrie going to texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on  youre a goddamn spy
i always lock my files  and you were the only one here today  what do you mean you son of a bitch
maybe theres more to this susie the cias keeping something from our enemies
i dont know if its coincidence but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan  six months after he arrives in russia francis gary powers u2 spy flight goes down in russia  that plane was untouchable powers hinted that oswald couldve given the russians enough data to hit it  as a direct result the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed  i cant help thinking of that book seven days in may maybe someone in our military didnt want the peace conference to happen maybe oswald was part of that  it gets weirder
who
or a cover up  jesus bill dont you have enough proof of the fbis complicity now
bill
its you i want to talk to bill
your boss got a serious problem bill  real serious  we know whats been going on at your office
youve got nothin bill  im talking as a friend now  youre riding on the titanic  time to jump off before you get destroyed along with garrison
who do you think fed him that information  garrisons going down were talking your career here bill your life  youre a young guy we know youre working that castro thing
correct me if im wrong  i thought we were on the same side  what the hell business is it of theirs to say that
what do you think lou
its addressed to no one and no signature  to leave this life is for me a sweet prospect  i find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand everything that is loathsome
the fact is hes gone chief and sos our case
yeah  they were seen together in clinton in early september  the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive
you know you keep saying that
clay bertrand  sure i know him  he comes around the quarter
i told your uncle i never met a lawman who wasnt a punk  you too bill even if youre family  hes a big shot businessman  i seen him on the tv news a lot with all the other big shots  a fag you know  goes by another name down here
shaw  clay shaw
yeah whats the big mystery everybody down here knows the guy
clay bertrand willie
did he pay you for this
there were about nine or ten people cubans friends of dave doing some stuff in the bush with him place was a mess  daves mind was a mess  yknow he had all those mice cages around cause hes working on this cure for cancer daves smart  real smart  speaks five languages knows philosophy medicine military history politics  he wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him cause he was queer
fuck yes  hell im already in jail  i got no reason to lie to you  i aint no nigger
hold your horses  what kinda source
morning boys  ready for a walking tour
what the hells a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banisters
lord wake me please  i must be dreaming
well its a terrific yard chief but the mans an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss
hell never sign a statement boss let alone get on a witness stand
and the six of us with almost no budget and in secret are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldnt solve  we cant keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is chief
im lost boss  what are we saying here
and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief  thats what youre saying
he had his palm print on the weapon
but why
i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this boss  susies stuff is colorful but
can you get some sworn statements
thats fine numa but what about all the people who arent writing letters  theyre sitting home reading all these lies  i just heard nbc crews in town to do a white paper  not on the kennedy killing but on us  one of their top guys harry stoner is talking to everybody he can find about you boss
those bastards  thats proof enough right there of what were up against the whole goddamn federal government bill
found another note same thing no name no signature  when you receive this i will be quite dead so no answer will be possible  i offered you love  all i got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth
all right all right  break it up
i dont buy it chief  why would the fbi cover it up  youre talking the whole fbi here  a telex that disappears from every single fbi office in the country
shaws our toehold bill  i dont know exactly what he is where he fits and i dont care  i do know hes lying through his teeth and im not gonna let go of him
i dont doubt their involvement bill but at a low level  could the mob change the parade route bill or eliminate the protection for the president  could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back  could the mob get the fbi the cia and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation  could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up  could the mob wreck the autopsy  could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep and since when has the mob used anything but 38s for hits up close the mob wouldnt have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude  assassins need payrolls orders times schedules  this was a militarystyle ambush from start to finish a coup detat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings
i know this bill  lyndon johnson got 1 billion for his texas friends brown and root to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam thats just for openers
if im so far from the truth why is the fbi bugging our offices  why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered  why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before
with a fullblown conspiracy to cover it up  yever read your shakespeare bill
julius caesar  brutus and cassius they too are honorable men  who killed caesar  twenty twentyfive senators  all it takes is one judas bill  a few people on the inside pentagon cia
whats it look like nick
nick what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid
can you ascertain if theres proloid in his system
well it doesnt make sense nick  he was afraid of dying then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes
mr goldberg you claim you met david ferrie and clay shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in new york you had drinks and under the influence discussed killing kennedy is that not so
why
i see and why are you experiencing this paranoia
oswald
ever called dean andrews
and have you ever met david ferrie
did you ever use the alias clay bertrand
you know damn well who it is
yeah you got it  since youre the only straight shooter in that fuckin office id like an answer from you did you plant it
somebody planted that fucking story and somebody tipped off the press im one of garrisons fucking suspects  i cant go home im out on the street  the maggots are everywhere  do you know what youve done to me  its all over the national news now  you know what youve done to me
im a dead man  from here on believe me im a dead man
you think your investigations been all that secret  you know when you talk to people they talk to other people
you still questioning any cubans
it leads farther than that
the fontainbleau  20 minutes
give me protection
im caught in the middle  theyre after me  its almost over
dave i always play square  no bugs id love you to go on the record but im in no hurry  whenever youre ready
did we involve you dave or did clay shaw
what do you mean
what about the mob dave  how do they figure in this
come in dave  have a seat make yourself comfortable  coffee
do you mind if i smoke mr garrison
thats not true  i never met anybody named oswald  anybody who told you that has to be crazy
no if he did i dont remember him  there were lots of kids in and out yknow
no i never saw him before in my life
yeah now thats true  i drove to houston
i hadnt been there ice skating in many years and i had a couple of young friends with me and we decided we wanted to go ice skating
oh it was just a spur of the moment thing  the storm wasnt that bad
we went straight to houston and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there
no particular reason  just to go somewhere
in the morning we went goose hunting then headed home but i dropped the boys off to see some relatives and i stayed in hammond
i believe the boys got a couple
oh yes well come to think of it theyre right  we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them  but you couldnt approach them  they were a wise bunch of birds
yes now i remember mr garrison im sorry i got confused  we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized wed forgotten our shotguns  stupid right  so of course we didnt get any geese
why  whats wrong
leons in a bad mood dont get excited hes all right
you mean about the cubans getting trained north of the lake
who was paying you dave
i dont know  were you  who you scared of dave
let me get this straight now  clay shaw is blackmailing you
was it the same oswald dave that was in dallas or was it an impersonator
did you take a good look at the tv when they had oswald
dave can i just ask you this directly  did you ever work for the cia
and shaw
what about ruby
then who killed the president
shit  forgot to glue this fuckin rug today  you know at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else  and then i lost that that fuckin clay shaw  i hate the bastard  all i got left is in his rotten bloody hands  he tipped the newspapers  i know it  thats how the agency works  they use people chew them up spit em out  now its my turn
theyll get to you too  theyll destroy you theyre untouchable man  im so fucking exhausted i cant see straight
colonel finck are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death was it not
your honor i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck
i dont remember his name  you must understand it was quite crowded and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead you dont look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are
no
no because there were others  there were admirals
im going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom
jesus ed from time immemorial its been standard booking procedure to ask an alias  you know that  theres no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions
thats our case
i cant believe youre saying this in the courtroom
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet
dad look what i drew
daddy  where have you been
are we going away daddy
because of kennedy  are the same people gonna kill us daddy
im scared
he asked me why i thought i was in danger and i said
that doesnt make sense mrs hill we have the man that killed the president
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots  he was getting hot under the collar and telling the woman not to write when he wanted
i want the truth
you heard echoes
i realize youre under a great deal of stress  its clouded your judgement
look we can put you in a mental institution  we can make you look craziern marguerite oswald and everybody knows how crazy she is
these new people never identified themselves  they musta been watching the whole thing cause they knew everything mary and me had been doing that day  i guess i wasnt too hard to find  wearing that red raincoat
four to six
which is strange cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination
we have that taken care of  you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this no one you hear
if we go to him our investigationll hit the front pages by sunrise blow up right in our face  ruby was just given a new trial  if he has something to say itll be there susie what did you find out on oswald
finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has  hes given 5000 rubles a roomy apartment with a balcony has affairs with local girls
dont get sidetracked  how does he get back to the states  thats the point  does he have any problems
this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific  he shouldve been prosecuted as a traitor
spas t raikin a leading member of an anticommunist group
none either  its bizarre  its next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out  nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in 63  a man who has defected once already  its crazy
the next thing we know hes living in dallasft worth in october 62 working 6 months at jaggarschiles stovall a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the us army he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes  oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man whod been in the army security agency
the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams  its through janet williams in october 63 that lee gets the warehouse job right smack on elm street at the book depository which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence
all i can find out about the williams is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance  so what is oswald a defector doing visiting his wife in his house williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program  he used slave labor to build the v2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him
now it gets positively spooky in january 1961  in new orleans at the bolton ford dealership  when the oswald we know is in russia  there is a man using the name oswald to buy trucks for the friends of democratic cuba  the salesman never saw him again but guess whos on the articles of incorporation of the friends of democratic cuba  guy banister  banister has someone using the name oswald to buy the trucks  hoover at the fbi writes a memo dated june 1960 that there could be someone using oswalds passport and identity
i dont believe it
i think clinton is a breakthrough shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald is that right  it proves hes a liar  keep on it bill 
arent you being a little hard
im sorry
im not sure i understand
i wouldnt imagine where
no  never heard of him
no
no i dont believe i know anyone by that name
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory mr okeefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter  a colored man  he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other  which he found rather unusual because the table was so long  does that bring back memories of willie okeefe
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you
who
no  i have never known anyone by that name  of course never having met mr okeefe i could hardly have met mr ferrie
let me show you his picture 
does the name clay bertrand mean anything to you
no it was not  do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews
mr shaw can you identify this man
mr shaw did you ever meet lee harvey oswald
please answer the question
mr shaw this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal politicalespionage activities  it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in 1960
and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma louisiana  which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans
and if i was mr garrison do you think i would be here today talking to somebody like you
may i go  regardless of what you may think of me mr garrison i am a patriot first and foremost
in the sheriffs report mrs mercer it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that
you mean you identified him on saturday the day before ruby shot oswald
but you didnt seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission
this says mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck  thats not true  i recognized him and i told them so they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck which it was not  and here  on the dallas sheriffs report this is really strange  see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page  thats not my signature and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning  i guess thats all
jim dinners just about ready ive got a surprise for you tried something new jim  jim dinner
i cant believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read whats in those volumes

we waited for you hours jim you could have telephoned for gods sake  its easter  you promised jim
i think you care more about john kennedy than your family  all day long the kids are asking wheres daddy  what am i supposed to tell your kids jim
that sounds dandy but it doesnt replace a father and a husband on easter day
did they live

did you enter virginia into a beauty contest
honey some crackpot  martin luther king was killed in memphis today
just a crank making phone calls happens a dozen times a day at the office
only cowards make crank calls sweetheart nothing is going to happen

i promise ill make more time for jasper
damn it if i say ill spend more time with him ill spend more time with him  i cant fight you and the world too liz
of course ive changed  my eyes have opened and once theyre open believe me what used to look normal seems insane  and now king  dont you think this has something to do with that  cant you see
thats not why im attacking him you dont believe me  all this time you never believed me
well so do i goddammit  so do i i had a life too yknow  i had a life too  but you just cant bury your head in the sand like some ostrich goddammit elizabeth  its not just about you  and your well being and your two cars and your kitchen and your tv and im jes fine honey  while our kids grow up into a shithole of lies  well im not fine about that im angry my life is fucked liz  and yours is too  and if you dont want to support me i can understand that but dont you go start making threats of taking the children away
and if youre wrong
they killed him honey
he won and they killed robert kennedy  they shot him down
i want to thank you mr okeefe for this time
for sexual purposes
anything else unusual about him youd be able to describe in a court of law willie
willie are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal  under the supervision of a doctor
you realize the things youre saying willie are going to be attacked by a lot of different people
no ones trying to buy you willie its important to know why youre telling us this
whats wrong lou
oh no how bad
one little guy with a cheap rifle  look what he can do
i know david  a strange character
remember whose office this was back in 63  531 lafayette street
id say he was probably getting intelligence training
the office of naval intelligence
post office
bill lou were standing in the heart of the united states governments intelligence community in new orleans  thats the fbi there the cia secret service oni  doesnt this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time
they took em to the sheriffs office not the police station and they let em go  no record of them ever being questioned
take a good look chief do any of em look like the hoboes you remember
graveyard dead  august this year  a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian texas  the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died 
can we find her
i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced
mobbed up all the way  tight with the dallas cops  im digging chief i just need 10 more men and some more dollars
goddamn sam
you dont get it guys  he cant go down any further  we got to protect him full time
i took it once for a low thyroid condition  it raises the metabolism lou  did david ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism
time
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other and it takes a minimum 23 seconds to recycle this thing  the other problem is there was a tree right there  blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film
it was a texas live oak boss  it sheds its leaves the first week of march  you try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13dollar sucker the worlds worst shoulder weapon  no way  the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswalds performance  not one  and oswald was at best a medium shot  the scope was defective on it too  i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me  the guy couldnt do the shooting  nobody could  and they sold this lemon to the american public
that means we gotta subpoena time life on it
when kennedy gets to the kill zone its a turkey shoot
who do you think changed the parade route
you know who the mayor was
earle cabell  and guess who his brother is
general charles cabell  deputy director of the cia  fired by kennedy in 61 because of the bay of pigs fiasco he moved back to the pentagon called kennedy a traitor  when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association you know who introduced him  our friend clay shaw
his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community
head of the cia since 53  kennedy fired them both  cabell was his deputy for nine years  talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop  now well have to subpoena them lou
maybe we should just call it a day lou  go home  while were still a little behind  we got two people killed maybe more we never thought about
chief ive had my doubts about bill for a long time  hes fighting everything
i just plain dont trust him anymore
are you giving me an ultimatum lou
i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me lou  ill accept your resignation
sad thing is the way its screwing up this country all these hippies running around on drugs the way young people look you cant tell a boy from a girl anymore  i saw a girl the other day she was pregnant  you could see her whole belly and you know what she painted on it love child  its fuckin outa control  valuesve gone to hell jim course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat johnson in the white house
i thought the fbi testfired the rifle to make sure it could be done
you know something always bothered me about that from day one and i cant put my finger on it
hell youre the district attorney you read the warren report  and then you tell me youre satisfied lee oswald shot the president all by his lonesome
welcome district attorney garrison may i call you jim
there have been a number of reports in reputable news media  time newsweek our own nbc  that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor that youve intimidated and drugged witnesses bribed them urged them to commit perjury  what is your response
some people would say youre paranoid
are they  why would they
pictures like this dont show up on television
jim garrison
im glad you came  im sorry about the precautions
i could give you a false name but i wont  just call me x
i dont i cant believe it  they killed him because he wanted to change things  in our time  in our country
the size of this is beyond me testify
i havent yet  i dont have much of a case
well thanks for coming
just speculating i guess  how do you think it started
hes done it before  other countries lumumba in the congo trujillo the dominican republic hes working on castro  no big deal  in september kennedy announces the texas trip at that moment second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket  y flies in the assassins maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens greece  pros maybe some locals cubans maria hire separate teams  does it really matter who shot from what rooftop  part of the scenery  the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone
dont think so  when they start to drool they get rid of em  these guys are proud of what they did they did dealey plaza  they took out the president of the united states  thats entertainment  and they served their country doing it
got promoted to two stars but he was never military you know always cia  went to vietnam lost his credibility when we got beat over there retired lives in virginia i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket
you never ask a spook a question no point  hell never give you a straight answer  general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more
i knew the man 20 years  thats him  the way he walked arms at his side military the stoop the haircut the twisted left hand the large class ring  what was he doing there  if anyone had asked him hed probably say protection but ill tell you i think he was giving some kind of okay signal to those hoboes  theyre about to get booked and hes telling em its gonna be okay theyre covered  and in fact they were  you never heard of them again
it never did 
heres my problem jack  you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time
and he never hit you before
how much more
well id ask guy  we were friendly you know  heart attack wasnt it
you have other information
why did guy beat you jack
dave ferrie  you know about him
where is banister in all this
like i said a fuckin nuthouse

welcome mr miller  jim garrison would you care for some coffee
im glad you could find time to see me  i flew down from denver this morning on my private jet
ive done quite well in denver mr garrison but i have to admire someone like you  and i have the means to back up what i say
theyve been enlarged and show a lot of detail
where were you  europe pacific
you were lucky  i spent three years in the pacific  ive never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bailbonding companies why is that
i know about that shot  a terrible tragedy  how much do you have for carrying on your investigation
how many men are working with you on this
thats all youve had all this time
im going to be very frank with you youve done a great job an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you  but the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion  youre not going to do this country any good and youre not going to do yourself any good  you dont belong here  on this mickey mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops
i propose you accept an appointment to the bench in federal district court and move into a job worthy of your talent  do you have any idea do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged
stop your investigation it was a magnificent effort but its over and done with  the press is already on your behind and thats only the beginning my boy only the beginning

she was more helpful than the fuckin public defender  i dont know  i guess what i need is a lawyer find out what my options are
youre not tired of it
what have they told you
id say if youre tried and found guilty you wont get more than a year and a day thats state time prison
but they wont want to take you to trial theyll offer you simple possession a few months of county time and a year or two probation  how bout another
you know who put the dope in your bag
they wanted you to tell them what you know
what did they want to know
that would be beaumont livingston
i wrote him on monday they found him dead on tuesday
same as you ten thousand
you mentioned a guy from lapd but you didnt mention the federal
no you didnt what branch
hes the one who wants you
cause if he busted you youd play hell bonding out of federal court he doesnt want you mad at him he wants you to tell him what you know he uses you to get a line on ordell make a case then take him federal you know what ordells into
i used to bring over ten thousand at a time thats the legal limit so i never brought more than that
with ten thousand nine
its all in lock boxes in a mexico bank but hes got a problem hes  what do you call it when you got money but dont have cash
thats it hes cash poor he kept on me till i finally said okay ill bring whatever fits in a nineby twelve envelope i got paid five hundred dollars and his friend mr walker in mexico gave me the envelope
whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened this aint solvin my problem i gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble im off today but if i cant leave the country im out of a job and if i dont got a job i cant hire a lawyer
yeah if i cooperate
but if all i can give em is ordells name  i dont really know shit about what he does or how he does it  that dont give me much to bargain with
whatdya think
if youre having some
you get a chance to use it
thanks but i have my own now
what i couldnt hear you
somebody loan it to you
want to hear some music
i couldnt wait till i got home last night and wash my hair
you never got into the whole cd revolution
this is pretty
who is this
76
i called in sick this morning as far as the airline knows im still available
i dont know yet im going to talk with dargus and nicolet today do what you suggested offer to help and see what happens
i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordells money
its a lot of money about a halfa million dollars all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in
he told me last night
he came by
he had his doubts at first but hes always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can
he needs me without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo sugar
how do you get it out
youre gonna offer to set him up
its very possible ordells killed somebody
how do you feel about getting old
im asking how you feel does it bother you
really
howd you feel about it
its different with men
my ass aint the same
does something else worry you
fifteen thousand
well hello
i walked right past you
catching a movie
american president
pretty good me and annette bening are goin steady
does it happen to all men
and annettes it for you
who was your girl before annette
yeah shes the girl who drove the bus in speed shes cute
why
how olds annette
whatre you a bag lady
you talk them into it
bring the money in and they follow it
you dont actually do it that way
make the delivery somewhere in the mall
will ordell go for that
he was here
i called you last night
you think hes got a thing for you
i dont follow your logic what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordells money
i see
has he hinted around
you know some interesting people
he tries to act cool
what about you max
no i mean you right now not it you were somebody else
you know where it came from its not like its anybodys life savings it wouldnt even be missed
youre avoiding the question
i have to stand behind all my active bonds but im not writing any new ones
a lot of reasons but the main one would be im tired of it
hi im max cherry your bail bondsman
yeah that night i went to pick up a guy i hear hes staying at this house so i sneak in wait for him to come home
got another gun and a stun gun
what do you do when he comes home
you do that
did you do it that night
and is that it
im not sure you answered my question
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a halfmillion dollars would you take it
dont even think about it you could get yourself killed go to prison
the feds its evidence
youre rationalizing
i told them ordells changed the amount hes bringing in
oh yeah i got them thinking ordells real nervous they love thinking hes scared of them
itll be more than that
but you still have to show him the money at the airport
wheres the rest of it
what if he checks it
youre takin a helluva chance kid
then youre out and you get nothing
youre gonna have surveillance all over you
in a dress
howd you find out
how does winston find him if atf and all the local police cant
hes liable to shoot you
ray wants him
thats why atfs gotta make the case im their witness they wouldnt have a case without me if its his word against mine who are they gonna believe
it never was so im not gonna start worrying about it now look ray more or less believes my story and he more or less doesnt care all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell
get ordell to come to your office
uhhuh
tell him i want to give him his money
ive chickened out im afraid of him hell like that
ordell called and wants to meet me and im scared
hes already there
i got your package it was fun getting a halfamillion dollars in the mail
only this isnt a bail bond max
you worked for it  if youre sure thats all you want
i saw ray the other day boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement
hes on to a new thing hes after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly selling assault rifles to minors he says hes gonna take him down if its the last thing he does
thats ordells
i didnt use you max
i never lied to you
were partners
id feel a whole lot better if you took some more money
wherere you going
madrid or barcelona

i thought you were tired of your business
you tell those guys theyll have to do one helluva lot better than that before ill even say hi to them

you said that the last time
we could if im not in jail
thats fifty thousand huh it doesnt look like that much
you didnt count it

that would be one point of view
how can i do anything if im being watched every second

wheres the bag she gave you
you took the time to pay the saleswoman

i didnt see him i was in my underwear if it was a white guy it was probably louis he kill melanie
i have no idea
if itll make you happy
louis garas dead lapd found him dead in a car on ninth and weve lost ordell
we were and we lost him he walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out the bar was on ninth less than a mile andahalf from where louis was found dead it looks like louiss friend shot him twice at point blank range

i dont know one of your friends
if you want
the next trip when i come with all the money itll look like i hand it to the same one i did before

i dont want no more fuckin surprises we do this the way i laid it out or we dont do it at all
sheronda passin the money onto someone else thats what the hell im talkin bout
i was there i saw her do it
i know but i hung around cause i figured youd try an pull some shit like this
nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills
it washes off i tell them were doing it the same way as before theyll follow sheronda i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall
are you sure she dont know about the money
what does she think shes gettin
no you gonna give her a robinsonsmay bag this time
she saw you with sheronda so simone goes to the dress department with her robinsonsmay bag
she waits for you to go in the place where you try things on

come on professor the armys not gonna give you any answers youll be buttin your head against a stone wall
not my head buddy not me im gettin a headache just listenin to you
come on jake that didnt hurt
i know you how come youre so tense today
i saw sarah the other day
a bit
turn on your right side  how about the other right  i dont understand you philosphers youve got the whole world figured out but you cant remember the difference between right and left
who
ah good now turn to your left
she says she cant get them new coats because you havent sent the alimony for three months
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you
loves me she hasnt said a kind word about me in years
she hates me louis
what she threw me out remember she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn only we didnt make it she cant forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in
what can i tell you louis after nam i didnt want to think anymore i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos
i cant relax
god almighty what did you do to me
i had this weird flash just then
i dont know ive been having them recently  you know you look like an angel louis an overgrown cherub anyone ever tell you that
louis youre a life saver
half an hour from now and youll be walking out of here all by yourself mark my words  well youve done it to yourself this time havent you
from a slipped disc thatd be a first
well ill see what i can do about it
perfect we got it  okay lets just give it a little try see if you can stand
what are you doing
what are you talking about you can barely stand
jake you need to rest
are you in the service
ah neither snow nor sleet nor dark of night  i always admired that
and how is your wife sarah no
ah
hmm i dont suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office
last i heard you were offered a posi tion in the west somewhere tuscon was it
jacob if it was any other brain but yours i might agree  tell me does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker what a sub lime intellect shes living with
ive got a problem prof more augus tine than kierkegaard if you know what i mean  i need to know about  demons
no  i see them
i know very little about demons ja cob fleshy ones anyway i know them as literary figures biblical ones  dante milton  but jacob  this is the 20th century we dont see demons now
christ i know how it sounds
yes  i dont want them im not looking for analysis or drugs its too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis  its more than that i can feel it i need you prof youre the only one i can talk to
demons i dont know what to tell you it sounds like a spiritual mat ter to me the problem jacob is that you have no context for it youre a renegade existentialist suf fering demons a hundred years after freud how the hell am i supposed to make it fit
jacob i dont believe in demons not in the empirical sense i dont be lieve in devils fighting for our souls i dont believe in enternal damnation i dont believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us we dont need them we do a good enough job on ourselves
look i dont pretend to know whats going on inside your head for all i know its pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart but if youre not willing to accept the help of sci ence and believe me i admire you for that then youll have to do bat tle on your own what can i say its a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls but to be pursued by  demons no less  there are no guides jacob  you wanna know what id do if i sud denly started seeing demons id hail the first taxi that came along shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment im no saint
id like to speak to dr carlson please

so first im arrested right best lsd i ever made right down the drain i figure this is it twenty years in the joint if im lucky that was 68
next thing i know im on rikers island ever been there  suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows you know four army colonels medals up their asses are standing on the other side they tell me if ill come to vietnam for two years no action mind you just work in a lab theyll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean well id only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam couldnt be any worse
no shit they had me by the balls next thing i know im in saigon  in a secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs not the street stuff mind you they had us isolating special properties the dark side you know they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies
right they were worried they figured you guys were too soft they wanted something to stir you up tap into your anger you know and we did it the most powerful thing i ever saw even a bad trip and i had my share never compared to the fury of the ladder
anyway this big offensive was coming up everyone knew it time magazine huntleybrinkley and the brass was scared cause they knew we couldnt win morale was down it was gettin ugly in the states hell you remember
none of us can remember that night i get flashes of it but they dont make sense we saw shrinks for years but nothing they did could ever touch it what happened was there ever an offensive
but there was an attack i can still see them coming there was a fight wasnt there
i always suspected the effects might come back thats why i had to follow you i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records
the truth can kill my friend five hundred men died out there this isnt a story theyd ever want out when pauls car blew up i realized the scope of the thing i knew they meant business
you come here often
how do i know this isnt just some kind of you know seduction or something
i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it
id hoped id never have to just open your mouth and stick out your tongue
dont worry take it itll free your head come on
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil but no one ever said i wouldnt be shittin in my pants every step of the way huh  stick out your tongue  thata boy now why dont you just lie down and relax

you too sweetheart
why dont we have one more drink you and i and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure whats inside him or not
home new york
colorful isnt he
nothing to worry about  ill survive this
yohoho and a bottle of rum
martin  are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority
now tell me something i dont know
i dont think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things
i cant work in a vacuum why dont you make hendricks chief his familys been here since the puritans  half this island are his cousins
ill get to that in a minute first i plan to start our seasonal summer help early and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea id like cooperation from local fishermen and ive also contacted the oceanographic institute over on the mainland
only 24 hours
larry if youd see these clowns leave youd never believe theyd come back with anything but they got him
whos that young man
why not larry we could get a positive confirmation that way
shes right
he lost it on the way up
we have got to close the beaches we have got to get someone to kill the shark we need noncorrosive mesh netting we need scientific support its gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have
youd love to prove that getting your name in the national geographic
got a pen on you
theres only one thing youre good for anymore  signing a damn voucher here its an authorization to employ a contractor
im going to hire quint to kill the fish i want to see that shark dead
forget it this summers had it next summers had it youre the mayor of shark city you wanted to keep the beaches open what happens when the town finds out about that
the best interest in this town would be to see that fish bellyup in the water with a hole in his head you do the right thing you authorize me  right there whatever it costs
theres a fantail launch out there that wont make it beyond the breakwater
officer i wonder if you could tell me where i could find chief brody
height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains torso severed in midthorax eviscerated with no major organs remaining may i have a drink of water right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature portions of denuded bone remaining   did you notify the coast guard
left arm head shoulders sternum and portions of ribcage intact  please dont smoke with minor post mortem lacerations and abrasions bite marks indicate typical nonfrenzy feeding pattern of large squali possibly carchaninus lonimanus or isurus glaucas gross tissue loss and postmortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis however teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters   did you go out in a boat and look around
well if one man can catch a fish in 50 days then i guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day  beginners luck
i didnt say this wasnt the shark i just said i wasnt sure this was the one
dynamite  how was your day
we ought to let it breathe whatever
drowning lemme ask you something is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water around 10 feet from the beach
something else do most attacks go unreported
theres a kind of a lone shark called uh
yeah rogue picks out an area where theres food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts
and before 1900 when people first starting swimming for recreation before public bathing and resorts there were very few shark attacks cause sharks didnt know what they were missing
and it was dartmouth winter weekend and she was homecoming queen and i was her date then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family and she was right  her greatgrandfather was in mining and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence
whats that
what what
how can you tell
he ate a car
nothing
if youre looking for a shark you dont look on land you go out and chum for him
what is all this stuff
can you tell from that if a big man eater is around
whered you get all this
youre at the institute full time or do you have a job
what happened
dont they have lifejackets or something an extra boat
he didnt have a dinghy aboard im going down to take a look at his hull
we will theres something ive got to find out
you all right
there is a kind of shark called a great white shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater
theres no limits to where he can strike and weve had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days it happened like this before in 1916 when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach in long island
a 4th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell for chrissake
im familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass there are only two ways to solve this thing you can kill it or you can cut off its food supply
wait a minute i need you
i hope we get some more help
this has got to be one big violation
whats that a ship
what the hell
dont shoot him any more hes crazy on his own blood already
quint
what day is this
think the tides with us
yknow i used to hate the water
christine what
you picked her up on the ferry
and nobody else saw her in the water
think she mightve run out on you

whered you hide the beach closed signs
polly told me to tell you theres a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges i couldnt call them in theres no phone out there

yeah the way i see it my outlook on the this situation is  its like getting fame you know what im saying its like if you died tomorrow and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first
you thirsty
you got any money
you down with the boost
you know like in the wonder twins they share everything
yeah the wonder twins you know  activate in the form of a glass of water
well those guys share everything right
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other where they lived the others life for a day you know those guys share everything right
and it got me thinkin how fun it would be to share each others girl
can you do it man
that girl you boned last year remember
but thats the thing girls like it slow they like romance they like things to be sweet and romantic
i mean ive been with a lot of girls i know
i hate this game
man this guy is really good
i wanna fuck darcy
darcy bennys little sister
yeah i like her ive wanted to get with her for a while now
yeah shes so little so pretty and innocent
its funny last weekend at that block party remember
she was handing out those watermelon slices and i sat down over on the other side and i watched her
i watched her eat the watermelon and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt
im not joking i wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there at that point and moment darcy was like a vision of perfection
at that moment at that block party she represented everything holy about a virgin
im gonna fuck her tonight i swear to god im gonna fuck her
i dont care motha fucka ill bet you money she fucks me
you wanna run by the park and see what everybodys doing get zooted
i dont understand why you do that
that
yeah why you give money
thats just it its elitist its reverse elitism because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up i notice what you do
whenever you see someone whos really messed up especially amputees and retards you give them money but if its just a regular bum you pass them by
so these people live on the same streets its just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up the regular bums arent poor enough for you you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks
right
shut up
so really its good luck
man telly your little brother is getting big

ive known the past of all the people ive fucked without a condom like i know one of the people got tested and was negative

i made her get tested with me because i didnt want to go alone

you want a wipit
so how many people live here now
where does everyone sleep
thats the whole thing you know if you look at it i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that and everyones dying and you better wear a condom or else but the truth is i dont know any kids with aids no one i know has ever died from that shit its like some weird makebelieve story that the whole world believes
first times are always wacked just be glad you didnt lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car
slow
yeah
right
yeah
yeah and it takes them either too long or too short to come have you ever had someone that took forever
it was it was
no no no you cant get that taste out of your mouth until you eat something
what man what is it
i cant man
shit all right but dont fuck with anything ok
ive talked to a few people who say you and her were friendly
by yourself
we seem to have a little problem here
i think youre lying  thats what kind of problem
casual
it wasnt serious  whats your problem
whats that supposed to mean
thats crazy  why would i draw attention to myself like that
he says on the photo hell call tomorrow at eleven  why not come back then and listen for yourself
meaning it looks like his victims are chosen at random
what do you mean no
all you gotta do is look at the map
morpheus
are you crazy
what in the hell do you think youre doing  slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace
we didnt ask for your opinion doctor
you dont tell us how to run our investigation  you got that
you know i figure thats pretty much how these girls feel just before they get it  you think im right
thats right  i guess only the killer would know that
the door was open
of course it was  otherwise id be breaking and entering  thats a felony
no
what if he doesnt bite  what if hes an exceptionally bright raccoon
you got it on the board
hes not talking about himself
then lets narrow it down
were interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there
you sure you werent over on pine road
youre a lying bastard
yes you are
you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy you crazy fuck
the message  i figured out
you want me to what
itll take hours  you cant make me do this
what are you talking about
sorry to ruin your trip to the city but we got a real nut on our hands frank
debi rutlege  female  caucasian twenty four  worked over at the four oaks hotel
what do you think
you think hes dirty
we wouldnt want someones death to interfere with your games
take it easy  both of you
no shit
sorry
the fbi has nothing remotely similar to this guy  i think hes a first timer
you still having a problem with this
weve checked  theres no one with the last name of emma on the island
how is she
you alright
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel
i spoke to jeremy  hes watching sandersons kid  sanderson went out after the match and hasnt come back since
what is it
ready for round two
you should be an actor frank  you looked like you were really mad  the veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch
why does he call sanderson
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing  but who called him today
a few people
what do you mean stand out
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious
it doesnt make sense because we dont understand it
dont fuck with us  where did you go
remember eventually revenge is carefully  have you tired juxtaposing the words
it isnt him  frank you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this
well find the evidence
hello peter
someone whos going to become an important part of your life  i want to play a game with you
hello peter
very amateurish peter  im surprised you would use such an obvious tactic  im not an idiot  dont treat me as one  ill call you everyday you get one minute whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you  are you ready to play
to get your attention
and  what path is that
why did you write remember on the wall
why not
i did another one last night  you might have saved her but you didnt want to play
youll find her
i suppose you want to know where im going to kill tonight peter
hello
you know her
why her
but you said you didnt know her
just like who
im just trying to play the game
im sure there are other people who would be interested in what i have to say
just for that no hint today
and you want these girls to feel your pain
how
huxleys quote also says his play is always fair and just
have you any idea what the message is
i couldnt tell you that  it would ruin the game  not that youre playing it very well
what
what makes you think i was there
its you whos running out of time youre starting to make mistakes now youre wondering just how much i really know  just how close im getting well im closer than you think pal  and im gonna nail your ass to the wall
hello
youre playing the tarakoss opening
youre next move should have been e2 e3
what word did you leave last night
interesting concept  i hadnt thought of that  if you think about how anton berger plays chess you might get it
hello peter
emotional  i expected more from you
by that time the game will be over
yes
let me speak to my daughter
please wait
its me you want  not her
that wouldnt be very sporting remember huxley  his play is always fair and just
ill give you anything you want anything  please
i was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die  but ive decided its better if you dont know exactly when i kill her goodbye peter
i know where you are
howd you know i wouldnt be in the same room with her
this isnt going to help david youre mothers dead  you cant undo it
yes i do  i found your file  i know what happened
dont you see  i had to make it right i ignored my mothers crossing  i sat with them all  i held their hands  i stroked their hair  i was with them to the end  i took away the blood  i washed them  their crossing was peaceful
naw its all fixed  i also loaded up a program thatll analyze your games three hundred percent faster
whats this
sure  weve got a modem line hooked up with the data base in new york
no problem  were in
nope  nothing
d2d4  b1c3 and c1f4  its the number two variation of the tarakoss opening  david can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years
now what
theres three  the first is 1983 lionel baines  the boston
1985  hans korshaud
what is it
computers  thats how you got into homesearchers records  you can get into anything  but why  why
what scars
you might not have done it had you known
would you mind keeping your voice down i have guests
the police came to me for help  what could i do
i admit i handled it badly  sanderson wasnt going to talk to me but youre young attractive
they asked who would be best suited for this and you
it worked out alright didnt it
feeling better
you dont want to believe it  its a normal reaction
kathy please  youre going to wear a hole in the carpet
youre safe  he wouldnt come here
why did he
come here
yeah  thats what weve always thought  but what if he wasnt  what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here
you must be erica
is your dad here
so are you having a good time on the island
thats only because you dont know where to go  you like hiking  fishing  sailing  what do you like
do you like my dad
i know he really likes you
okay  nice meeting you
congratulations dad
what are you doing up
i see  you forgot to bring youre nightlight didnt you
you want to sleep in my bed tonight
who told you that
has he gotten through to any
what is it dad
dont you have something you want to say to david
you ready
you told me youd take me over to seattle today
it isnt kathy
whaddaya got nolan
how long has she been dead
any sign of rape
theres no blood  wheres the fuckin blood
anything
what about prints
you mean no prints but hers
he tapes their mouths shut  we found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths  were doing a chemical analysis for components but its probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store
this is where he forced his way in  we found some fibers on the windowsill probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through ill know more once i get it under the microscope
same as the others
how long she been dead
well
you didnt pick up any vibes from the guy
only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case youre working on  whatd he do
what do you think he did
im busy right now
i see youre still having problems with your openings
no  i told him to  i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end
kathy
that would indicate hes playing out a fantasy  powercontrol killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them  once they become a reality though they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it  but in all the research ive read on serial killers ive never heard of one moving so fast its as if the game is the catalyst for the murders  not the other way around
yes  why disguise your voice if no one knows it
i dont think it matters  last nights victim christie eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town the night before debi rutlege was found in the center
his home would be mount olympus
before we go in i gotta tell you this isnt going to be pretty
you never know how youre going to catch a suspect
well i think you have to play to his ego  he thinks hes superior  the more secure he feels the more chances hell take
maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have  all the girls that have been killed have been killed at night  theyre all the same type  all moved into their homes within the last three months  and all of them found their homes through homesearchers
it cant be a coincidence  the woman that owns it has a son  she says hes been on vacation in montana for the last ten days  were trying to locate him  theres also a cleaning service that comes in once a week  were checking that out too
each of those grids represents almost a square mile
as large as castles
what time did he get there
hes right kathy
we cant rely on your judgement anymore
and what if hes wrong  if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you wouldve arrested him  if it is someone else then hes going to kill again tonight and youre sitting here ignoring the message
this stinks  you want to know what i think  i think there have been five murders and youve got shit to go on you need to blame someone and hes the easiest choice
did you see his face
i cant arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist  do you have someone you can stay with tonight
if you can think of anything else give us a call
excuse me you said earlier that mary albert just moved in  how long ago was that
do you know how she found the apartment
i know youre busy so ill get right to it  did you know her
could you tell me where you were last night
i know  you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five  where did you go after that
this is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room  heres one at 904 pm  it says  from debi  please call me at home
whats interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing  yet she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesnt leave a number that would imply you already knew the number
why didnt you tell us you were there earlier
mister sanderson this is doctor sheppard  shes a psychologist helping us out
you want me to go with you  maybe i can help
what have you come up with on the riddle
maybe but i dont think so  i think its just a tease
thats it
another one  what word did he leave
as large as castles  you are still light as air one hundred men cant move me
hes using the map as a chessboard the sonofabitch is playing chess with me
i still dont see how he could be playing chess against you  theres only enough grids on the map to be half a board
its a commercial area  no one lives there
as large as castles you are still light as the air one hundred men cant move me  its posed as a question what am i
hes not going to give us direct hints hes going to skirt around it
a shadow  whats as big a castle  as light as air  but one hundred men cant move it  the shadow of the castle  are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building
where were you last night
answer the question
jeremy would have never killed himself
dont you understand what im telling you  thats why he wants me out of the way
alright cmon peter  were moving you to a cell
did you send the car
you opened with the english  lutz wont use it  he opened his first game with it
then ill transpose
its a good play but risky
we got a problem
peter
youre always in the middle of a match
you have something you want to say
about what
what do you see here
she went into town with mrs lutz  did they get him
feel like practicing
bainbridge books
i can check and call you back
bainbridge books
yes doctor sheppard  we called you back but you werent home  we have the book
of course  yes here it is  why theyre all the same
sorry  i thought it was empty
is this your first time here
i love this hotel  i stay here every time i visit my parents
because i love them but they drive me crazy  you know how parents are
are you with the tournament
are you one of the players
ive always wanted to learn how to play chess  i dont have the patience for it  when did you start playing
it seems like such a complicated game
sounds very violent
but you enjoy being the stronger one you like the control
thats a very personal question
are you disappointed that i wont answer you
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess
do you always open quickly
you
well i think ive had enough
what are you looking for
they couldnt break the riddle
we need your help
but youre the key  the one he wants to play the game with
she could be dead after the game
you sure you dont want to eat something
its going to be a long night  it could take hours before we know something  you should try to eat
it wasnt intentional
i think its interesting
in a way
oh but it is  hes killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him  thats a game  it has rules and objectives
take your average cop  they deal with death everyday  if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement
what about you  arent there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry
do you
im just curious
you mean like in the steam room
youre projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did
you have to win every point dont you
of course
no
relax
i know it was bad
i know you didnt
doesnt that scare you
why
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it
you know youre not the easiest person in the world to get close to
wasnt i just talking about me
alright  what about me
she died in a car accident
its alright  it was a long time ago
it was
what
im not playing a game now
what is this
nobody could attack you  you set your life up like one of your chessboards youre impregnable  but at the same time youve become trapped behind your own defenses  youre cut off from everyone around you
i just dont want to fight with you
this frightens me  because im starting to feel things i havent felt in a long time
i thought you were the woman who didnt want to get involved
you can turn everything around so easily  this is not just another game is it
im hungry
fine
you
did you call
theyre not delivering  im going to go pick up the pizza
i tried again and got through
nothing
peter you have to admit
peter
in a fierce magazine youll find a hint of my actions to come why does he set this line apart
exactly  its the key
a fierce magazine brutal  an angry magazine a war magazine a mercenary magazine  fierce  mad
hes replaying the game i played against him move by move using these girls as the chess pieces  all the girls have been found in their homes except christie eastman who was found in back of a warehouse  why
hi
the other night  i said some things that maybe i shouldnt have  i mean you havent known me very long and i can see how you thought what you did
i was thinking that maybe when this is all over we could
peter
thats still no excuse  you treat everything like a game
youre wife died  you cant feel responsible for that
then help me to understand  i want to understand
of course it isnt  its always difficult when someone you love dies but you cant feel responsible because she had a car accident
why
this letter  ive never opened it
because i know what it says
if we could just figure out what the next word is going to be  he said the games going to end tonight so theres only going to be one more word
how did you know it was carefully
youre right  the killer told me
this isnt going to be like the phone book is it
youre going to be late for your match
you beat him
its over now
hello peter  you played an interesting game last night  even though sacrificing your queen at b5 is the game i played against valsney in 82  im glad it helped you
no i want you to do good  that way when i beat you at the end ill look that much better
im not nervous
im sorry i couldnt help it
you dont understand im just so urelievedu i was usureu youd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy
me too
mine was worse i dreamt you picked your nose in public
youre really not bad looking almost handsome
you umightu be handsome i cant tell through all that grime besides you reek of sweat and horses
take off your clothes im going to scrub you down
were almost married
i dont trust you to wash behind your ears
there now you look like someone i might want to marry
i dont have to look around ive found the husband i want you can kiss me now
i lied
lyssa  lyssa 
have they harmed you
lyssa where are they keeping you
lyssa 
where is the fortress
i will find you i will be with you
i love you lyssa i love you 
colwyn 
will your power outward
take the western passage
yes
lyssa 
in the arctic ice
thats a better one
youll both wait at least for five hours the wedding is at three
they have lyssa
you will go alone
you will do as i tell you you will try to reach ynyr the old one
the white castle has fallen
the new queen lives
we were married then she was taken by the slayers you must help me
this is not the first time the dark ones have attacked our world they came once before a thousand years ago a young king and queen with extraordinary powers were given to us then to lead the struggle my forefather was their councilor as i will be yours
your powers are greater than you know  have you ever seen one of these
with two or three days practice youll be able to use it as well as i can then well have a chance of fighting our way out of here
there is no other way
but it opens onto the sheer wall of the needle theres no way down
i am too old to climb down a rope
there is nothing
you must break when the strain becomes too great or you will harm yourself and you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most what did she answer
it is the fortress of krull i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds they did not use it on our world in the first great war for it costs them enormous power this time they mean to conquer at all costs
yes each dawn it rises in a different land sometimes in the mountains sometimes in the jungle sometimes the desert sometimes the sea never in the same place twice
no they occupy the fortress but they cannot control its movement it is moved by fate and sooner or later fate will place it near us
you have not slept in two days
you choose these
they know when theyre going to die
i cant reach her
she cant see out she cant tell us where the fortress is
she was very faint i was barely able to reach her
i cannot reach her
the first time when they attacked long ago was the beast here
uwhyu
but you suspect
no we will find another way to locate the fortress
yes
lyssa uwhyu
can she be forced
never
then we must reach her before she feels that pain
traitor shell marry you in hell
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat old man
from here i must go alone
he ran a great risk helping us today if he opposes his fate his death will be terribly painful
they will hold lyssa in the center of the vortex the place of the beast where its power is greatest no man can match it there lyssa must try to move toward us for as we enter the vortex and move closer 
she must make a glaive
the spiral begins in the west
shes on the other side of this wall i can feel it
she can see the beast
what use is my sword i cant reach her
you must move quickly the beast will stop at nothing now
it is my fate to die in the fortress
i can because i choose it
how did you know
slayers
do not let the waters touch you
they can be saddled
i road them often in my youth
it is today
each to his fate
i know the cruelty of such a fate
am i not worth returning to
am i not beautiful enough to be loved
even by you
you too are lonely
let me comfort you
then give me comfort sleep with me tonight
i feel your pain but i cannot betray her
help help im drowning
it could have been quicksand i might have been sucked to my death  where is this place
blast a thousand miles off course well i was rushed there was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie the foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill what did he expect
i just remembered i have urgent business in this direction
once is enough thank you
your kingship  your lord high mightiness  when i called you a  a  whatever i called you i didnt realize that you were  were 
my ufriendu
not yet my friend its your tomato thats dying
try your tricks on me and ill turn myself back into a snake and bite you
i dont think youll grow careless
fame
fame is what you leave to your sons
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for
they stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes  do you know who i am sprout i am torquil lord of the forest my men follow no man but me and i follow no man at all
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crowfood tell me why i am going to follow you

im not hungry
forgive me its childish to cry

yes it will double our range  i know at least a dozen ways to get horses all cheap
lad you have an unnatural desire to pay for things it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination
forgive me my friends i saw terrible things
go join them
the best but my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding yours to it
go i command you
we could reach it on firemares
we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise
youre resourceful my lad  i tell you one year under my tutelage and i could make you the prince of thieves
a good thrust my friend another second and thered have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories
make for the wall ill catch up
nothing worse than lowerclass boors with upperclass morals

it is the way of all invaders those they would conquer they divide buying allies with promises of land and power
lord rowan is one of lyssas godfathers he will defend her in the ceremony i wish that lord modred were here he is a godfather of her own blood
for some the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood no matter i had hoped to have the wedding next spring lord turold with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance but fate and this war have ordained otherwise
i will tell you something you did not know turold had it been my choice all those years ago i would have chosen you for my king but my parents chose otherwise

i tried to reach ynyr the old one i led a hundred men to his place in granite needle but it was surrounded the dark ones guard it by night and by day they call out the slayers ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in
sixty at the needle another thirty in the forest only ten of us made it back
modred impossible
we seek the fortress of krull
the new king
you know the voice
it is the time
can you see
the dark ones will appose you with all their power
knowledge i wouldnt want
well seek an emerald seer they have great powers of vision
we can save half a day by crossing the stone lake
the leader of the dark ones
i must go to the widow perhaps she will help
yes
she has the power of vision
perhaps she will not kill me for i know her name
few have survived it
each to his fate lad
we must reach the valley of reeds before the next dawn
ill stay behind and keep them busy

but you would not stay with me
she was not as beautiful
she bore you many children
you had a son
you had left me i kept silent out of rage

memory is no trick it is a power the power to see
knowledge
the fortress of krull when will it come near here

you moved too didnt you
huh because of the slaughter at your same floor
its better  you see its my turf so i dont want contracts im not informed about on my turf  im not opposing but the least they can do is informing me isnt it
at a certain moment i thought maybe leon would like working on his own so he makes some little extras

ok im fine
here this is the light scoop for night shooting there you fix clients distance how much to the bench down there in the park
130 140
look when you can see his fingers its 50 meters  when you just see his hands its about 80 meters when you distinguish arms from body its 120130 when you see nothing more than a shape you dont shoot  not very sure you have one chance out of five to miss  a contract means getting all chances on your side 5 out of 5  you cant miss a client never if the task is delicate or the risk is too big you double that is you insure yourself by another means
well if the guy is far in a car and i know weather is going to be bad rain for example i think i would plastic the car with a remote here i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic
rocket launcher
wow its brilliant
wholl i aim at
the fat man down there on the bench
good first shot
its not serious its just training you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target then to improve precision youll train but on cardboards
the yellow and pink
whats up i dont feel youre concentrated
its incredible how did you do it
five minutes keep in front of the window
come on get down
i was nervous thats all where is the guy
its strange being in love its the first time for me
mathilda may i come in
why dont you take me with you im ready now  you said i learn very quickly
may i go to the cinema
for musicals  thats part of the job
you see five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me but i prefer this
you can leave whenever you want i dont refrain you
not taken
well then may you rent me your gear for the day
if you knew leon  i killed one thousand in my head  and this never disturbed my sleep
its true but a first contract its an exception
im going to kiss you
stop everyone is looking
you dont believe me dont you
when i say i love you
ok  i love you anyway
ok ok excuse me how old were you when you had your first contract
shit  wed found him we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window
where are you going
its cool departing this way warm music
id like knowing what hes listening to
mathilda hadnt you told that bullshit to the receptionist wed still be in the hotel i make you notice
i prefer apartments  furthermore there are always kids in a building what about getting some friends
youre darkening the picture arent you
is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy
its too big
risky business isnt it
mathilda theres equally a lot of other things
no excuse me its the yogurt that made me laugh

im here ill never leave you again mathilda never i swear
poor darling and then

why did you have too many and you fear it may shock me  i wont get shocked im used to this  my father was a true pig he fucked the bitch id as mother all around the apartment whenever a door was closed you could be sure they were making sex behind it  and my sister if you didnt sleep with her youre buildings exception
i had a girlfriend a long time ago  before coming here in my country i was 14yearold we flirted like kids  her father didnt want her to meet me  my family was not very respectable
thats awful  i hope you killed that asshole

the normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion  this is called claudication  as a result there isnt enough circulation to your body  that accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms im sure youve encountered

well hello
you know what i can play baseball with my brothers when im bigger
you know what im just little now but ill be big soon
i thought you were asleep
your parents would want you to be in bed
there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball but he was too small and no one would let him play but he kept practicing by himself  waiting he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove
anyway big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands  who can play baseball and there was a little voice that yelled out me i can play everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove
right  but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed but not big billy  he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game  it came to the end of the game  it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game
okay nine  big billys team was losing and he was on base  thats when isaac came up  he could barely hold the bat big billy winked at isaac the ball was pitched  isaac hit the ball hard it soared up and out over the stadium  everyone cheered  isaac hit a home run and won the game after the game isaac asked big billy why he let he play  big billy smiled and said i wasnt always big billy i was little billy first isaac and big billy went off after the game and read a classic book together  the end
each inch represents 150 miles

no i think youre talking about you ill tell you right now that im in love with you but be that as it may im not here to force my twisted life into your soul
and im not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life we know im a drunk but that seems to be all right with you and i know that youre a hooker i hope you understand that im a person who is totally at ease with this which is not to say that im indifferent or that i dont care i do it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement what im saying is that i hope you understand that i understand
ah yes i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck

i like women who wear mismatched earrings
what do you mean
how are you doing
well  i was prepared for worse but it wasnt so bad we were sitting at the bar talking about blackjack you seemed just fine a little drunker than usual but nothing really strange but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then wham you swung you arm at me and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress you smashed everything on her tray it was a real mess you kept yelling and yelling
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me  not like you wanted to hit me but more just waving me away security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street but i talked them into letting me walk you out
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home i also promised that we would never come in there again
you were ok for a while so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck but i think even you knew that wasnt going to happen we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store even though i told you that we had plenty at home in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change i asked you if you knew it was a hundred you said you did so i let you do it we got here you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed
heres my speech  i know this shouldnt be acceptable to me but it is dont ask me why i sense that your trouble is very big and im scared for you and so im doing what i think you need me to do falling down in casinos is little stuff it doesnt bother me it has nothing to do with us
why dont you go back to sleep ill go out and buy us some breakfast
very creative now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers

ill be back home around three if youre back by then we can watch tv or something i guess what im saying is that i hope you are back when i get home please be careful
shall we go away for a couple of days
years ago in la i turned a trick on sunset and western the guy was polite and didnt argue about the price he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room the room had a bed and a dresser he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up i felt kind of guilty because he hadnt come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes but he said it was all right and began dressing when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car i remember being relieved that i wouldnt have to work again that evening

brooke i believe you but a jury is gonna want an alibi

is he always such an ass

he thinks im guilty doesnt he
im a delta gamma and im a huge fan of yours

whats going on
i got out of the shower walked downstairs saw her standing over my father and called the police
no
uh yeah because the bitch shot him
okay  ms windham when you uh arrived back at the house was your father there
and when you came downstairs what happened
but mrs windham didnt have a gun
did you hear a shot fired
so at some point in the  twenty minutes you were in the shower your father was shot
but you didnt hear the shot because you were in the shower
miss windham can you tell us what youd been doing earlier in the day
where you got in the shower
yes your honor had you ever gotten a perm before miss windham
how many would you say
chutney why is it that tracy marcinkos curls were ruined when she got hosed down
and if you in fact heard the gunshot then brooke windham wouldnt have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs which would mean that you wouldve had to have found mrs windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible isnt that right
dewey newcomb
come again
